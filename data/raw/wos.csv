Rational fertilization in agricultural production is crucial for safeguarding SOC stock. In this study, field experiments were conducted with different ratios of chemical fertilizer reduction and organic fertilizer substitution for three consecutive years (2018-2020) to explore their effects and interlinkages on SOC fractions, soil properties and SOC stock.RESULTSThe results showed that organic fertilizer substitution increased SOC and its fractions content, SOC stock (by 3.98-12.98% and 7.15-18.13%) and soil fertility index (by 11.76-49.26% and 33.33-91.47%) compared to conventional fertilization in 2019 and 2020, while chemical fertilizer reduction had the opposite effect. Moreover, soil properties (except total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio, N/P) and SOC fractions significantly affected SOC stock, with SOC fractions contributing more than soil properties. The high sensitivity of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can indicate changes in soil carbon pool. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that organic fertilizer substitution increased SOC content and stock by increasing SOC fractions [recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC) and labile organic carbon (LOC) fractions] content and soil fertility.CONCLUSIONSOur study revealed the corresponding mechanisms of the two fertilization modes affecting SOC stock changes. The use of organic fertilizer substitution is recommended to increase SOC stocks and soil fertility in wheat fields.

As an alternative, the partial substitution of organic fertilizer may help to regulate N2O emissions. However, studies assessing the effects of partial substitution of organic fertilizer on both N2O emissions and yield stability are currently limited. We conducted a field experiment from 2017 to 2021 with six fertilizer regimes to examine the effects of partial substitution of manure on N2O emissions and yield stability. The tested fertilizer regimes, were CK (no fertilizer), CF (chemical fertilizer alone, N 300 kg ha -1, P2O5 150 kg ha -1, K2O 90 kg ha-1), CF + M (chemical fertilizer + organic manure), CFR (chemical fertilizer reduction, N 225 kg ha -1, P2O5 135 kg ha-1, K2O 75 kg ha-1), CFR + M (chemical fertilizer reduction + organic manure), and organic manure alone (M). Our results indicate that soil N2O emissions are primarily regulated by soil mineral N content in arid and semi-arid regions. Compared with CF, N2O emissions in the CF + M, CFR, CFR + M, and M treatments decreased by 16.8%, 23.9%, 42.0%, and 39.4%, respectively. The highest winter wheat yields were observed in CF, followed by CF + M, CFR, and CFR + M. However, the CFR + M treatment exhibited lower N2O emissions while maintaining high yield, compared with CF. Four consecutive years of yield data from 2017 to 2021 illustrated that a single application of organic fertilizer resulted in poor yield stability and that partial substitution of organic fertilizer resulted in the greatest yield stability. Overall, partial substitution of manure reduced N2O emissions while maintaining yield stability compared with the synthetic fertilizer treatment during the wheat growing season. Therefore, partial substitution of manure can be recommended as an optimal N fertilization regime for alleviating N2O emissions and contributing to food security in arid and semi-arid regions.","2023-01-15","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:13","2023-01-23","","","","326","","J.

However, the influence of organic fertilizer substitutions on NH3 and N2O emissions from farmland is unclear. Thus, we set up an organic substitution field experiment in Northeast China. The experiment included six treatments: single application of chemical fertilizers (NPK: 250 kg N ha(-1)); NO10, 10% reduction in chemical nitrogen fertilizers (225 kg N ha(-1)) + chicken manure (25 kg N ha(-1)); NO20, 20% reduction in chemical nitrogen fertilizers (200 kg N ha(-1)) + chicken manure (50 kg N ha(-1)); NO30, 30% reduction in chemical nitrogen fertilizers (175 kg N ha(-1)) + chicken manure (75 kg N ha(-1)); NO40, 40% reduction in chemical nitrogen fertilizers (150 kg N ha(-1)) + chicken manure (100 kg N ha(-1)); and no-nitrogen fertilizer (CK). This experiment investigated the effects of partial substitution of chemical nitrogen fertilizer with organic fertilizer on NH3 and N2O emissions and nitrogen use efficiency in a maize field. The results showed that, compared with chemical N, organic fertilizer mitigated NH3 volatilization but promoted the soil N2O total emissions during the whole growth stage. NH3 cumulative volatilization decreased with the increase in the substitution rate of organic fertilizer. Compared with the NPK treatment, the cumulative volatilization of NH3 in the NO30 and NO40 treatments decreased by 15.24 and 17.92%, respectively. The NO40 treatment had the highest N2O emission in the whole growth stage, and the N2O emission of the NO40 treatment increased by 10.72% compared to the NPK treatment. Moreover, the yield, partial factor productivity (PFP), nitrogen harvest index (NHI), and apparent nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE) of NO30 treatment were the highest of all treatments, and the yields, PFP, plant N accumulation, grain N accumulation, and the cumulative emissions of NH3 and N2O were similar to N-20 treatment. In conclusion, nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency was enhanced, decreasing environmental pollution from livestock under organic fertilizer substitution conditions. We suggested 20% or 30% substitution rates of organic fertilizer were proper.","2023-04","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:13","2023-03-22","53115-53127","","18","30","","Environ. Sci. Pollut.

Consequently, there is an immediate need for a chemical fertilizer reduction strategy that ensures crop productivity and improves soil quality and the ecological environment of farmland. This study implemented a three-year (2018-2020) field experiment with two chemical fertilizer reduction methods (direct fertilizer reduction and organic substitution) to investigate their effects on wheat productivity, soil quality, heavy metal pollution risk and microbial characteristics. The results showed that organic substitution treatments (OF1, OF2 and OF3) improved most wheat plant (nutrient uptake and yield and its components) and soil properties (soil nutrients and carbon and nitrogen fractions), leading to increased crop productivity index (CPI, by 9.18 %-16.39 % and 14.14 %-23.36 %) and soil quality index (SQI, by 84.67 %-138.86 % and 104.11 %-175.91 %) compared to conventional fertilization (CF) and direct fertilizer reduction treatments (RF1, RF2 and RF3) in 2019 and 2020. Additionally, organic substitution enhanced the diversity and network complexity of bacterial community, while raising the soil pollution index (SPI, by 9.30 %-12.84 % and 12.20 %-18.49 %) without causing soil heavy metal pollution. Thus, it is recommended to adopt organic fertilizer substitution as the primary chemical fertilizer reduction strategy for wheat production. This approach will ensure crop yield, and improve soil quality and microbial characteristics, but its long-term application requires monitoring changes in soil heavy metals. Overall, this study provides guidelines for implementing scientific fertilization in agricultural practices, thus contributing to the health and sustainability of farmland ecosystems.","2024-11","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:14","2024-08-20","","","","36","","Environ.

Partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer was considered as a possible strategy for sustainable agricultural development, but its potential effects on soil quality, GHGs emissions, and crop productivity remain unclear. A field experiment across 3-year was conducted to evaluate the responses of soil quality, nitrous oxide (N2O), 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO2), 2 ), and methane (CH4) 4 ) emissions, and crop yields to different ratios of organic fertilizer (OF) to synthetic fertilizer (SF). Six treatments were included: non- fertilization (CK); total SF; total OF; 15 %, 30 %, and 45 % organic substitution (LO, MO, and HO). Soil cumulative N2O 2 O emission was decreased with increasing organic substitution ratios, mainly attributing to the reducing soil NH4+ 4 + content. However, organic substitution increased soil CO2 2 and CH4 4 emissions due to the high manure-driven C input, consequently promoting global warming potential (GWP). Meanwhile, soil organic C, total N, P, available P, K, and C-acquisition enzyme activities were increased with organic substitution, resulting the higher soil quality index (SQI) under HO and OF. HO enhanced the annual yield of wheat and maize by 7.2 % and 13.0 % compared with SF and OF, respectively. The positive relationship between crop yield and SQI indicated that the yield-enhancing effect with partial organic substitution was mainly attributed to the improved synchronization in nutrient supply and soil fertility. Overall, partial organic substitution, especially 45 % organic substitution represents a viable strategy to improve soil quality and crop productivity while mitigating N2O 2 O emission in wheat-maize rotation systems. However, organic substitution promoted the GWP through stimulating soil CO2 2 and CH4 4 emissions. Further investigations of optimize fertilization managements are still needed to reduce manure-induced CO2 2 and CH4 4 emissions to achieve higher climate change mitigation.","2024-12","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:14","2024-09-06","","","","244","","Soil Tillage Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001302907200001","","","15 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the current understanding of the underlying microbial mechanisms in response to bio-organic fertilizer substitution for chemical fertilizer is primitive, particularly in greenhouse vegetable production system. Herein, we present the field experiment that spans five years and encompasses four treatments, including no fertilizer (CK), chemical fertilizer (CF), bio-organic fertilizer (OF), and chemical fertilizer combined with bio-organic fertilizer (COF) in the greenhouse vegetable production system. We aimed to investigate the effects of replacing chemical fertilizer with bio-organic fertilizer on soil N2O emissions and nitrogen-cycling microbial communities. The OF and COF treatments reduced soil N2O emissions by 70.2 % and 32.3 %, respectively, compared with the CF treatment. The substitution of chemical fertilizer with bio-organic fertilizer led to a reduction in residual nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen levels in the soil. Additionally, it enhanced the abundance of functional genes associated with both soil assimilatory nitrate reduction and dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes. These changes likely facilitated the conversion of nitrate nitrogen to ammonium nitrogen and mitigated soil denitrification. Additionally, bio-organic fertilizer significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the activity of soil-denitrifying microorganisms and increased the abundance of soil nitrogen-fixing genes to reduce N2O emissions. These results indicate the potential of using bio-organic fertilizer instead of chemical fertilizer to reduce reactive nitrogen emissions in greenhouse vegetable production system, which can contribute to the development of environmentally friendly fertilization strategies.","2025-07","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:15","2025-05-07","","","","211","","Appl.

The implementation of water-saving irrigation and the substitution of chemical fertilizers with organic alternatives can influence CH4 and N2O emissions in rice fields. However, it remains unclear how the simultaneous application of both methods will affect the CH4 and N2O emissions in rice fields. Therefore, two irrigation methods (F: flooded irrigation; C: controlled irrigation) and three fertilization modes (A: full chemical fertilizer; B: bio-organic fertilizer replacing 15% chemical nitrogen fertilizer; C: bio-organic fertilizer replacing 30% chemical nitrogen fertilizer) were set up through field experiments to explore the effect of greenhouse gas emission reduction in rice fields by combining controlled irrigation and bio-organic fertilizers. Substituting some chemical fertilizers with bio-organic fertilizers can lower the peak CH4 and N2O fluxes in rice fields, leading to a decrease in the cumulative CH4 and N2O emissions by 11.9 similar to 29.7% and 10.8 similar to 57.3%, respectively. The reductions led to a considerable decrease in the global warming potential (GWP) and the greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) by 16.1 similar to 48.1% and 16.3 similar to 48.1%, respectively. Controlled irrigation significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 55.2 similar to 69.4% compared with flooded irrigation in rice fields. However, it also increased N2O emissions by 47.5 similar to 207.9%, considerably reducing their GWPs by 11.8 similar to 45.5%. Neither bio-organic fertilizer substitution nor controlled irrigation significantly affected rice yield. Replacing 15% of chemical nitrogen fertilizers with bio-organic fertilizers in controlled irrigation rice fields can minimize rice GWP and GHGI. The study's results are of significant importance for enhancing the regulation of greenhouse gases in farmland and achieving sustainable agriculture through cleaner production.","2024-03","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:39","2024-04-04","","","3","14","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001191959500001","","","8 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field experiment was carried out over two consecutive years, and a total of six treatments were set up: no fertilizer (CK), chemical nitrogen fertilizer alone (N), the substitution of 25% of chemical nitrogen fertilizer with bio-organic fertilizer (N25A1), the substitution of 25% of chemical nitrogen fertilizer with fermented mealworm manure (N25B1), the substitution of 50% of chemical nitrogen fertilizer with bio-organic fertilizer (N50A2), and the substitution of 50% of chemical nitrogen fertilizer with fermented mealworm manure (N50B2). The results of this study show the following: (1) Compared with chemical nitrogen fertilizer, the substitution of organic fertilizer for nitrogen fertilizer reduced the bulk density and solid phase of the soil, and it increased the total porosity, water content, liquid phase, and gas phase of the soil. (2) Compared with nitrogen fertilizer, the use of an organic fertilizer increased the contents of nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and total nitrogen in the soil by 13.59 similar to 52.56%, 4.47 similar to 18.27%, and 4.40 similar to 12.09%, respectively. The content of alkaline nitrogen increased by 1.70 similar to 32.37%, and the contents of soil available potassium, available phosphorus, and organic matter also increased. (3) The activities of sucrase, urease, glutaminase, and asparaginase were improved by replacing chemical nitrogen fertilizer with organic fertilizer.

However, past research was usually conducted in regimes with excessive nitrogen (N) fertilization, which was not conducive to the current national goal of green and sustainable development. Therefore, exploring the potential of organic fertilizer substitution for mineral N fertilizer under regimes with reduced N inputs is important to further utilize organic fertilizer resources and establish sustainable nutrient management recommendations in the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation system in North-central China. In this study, a 4-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different chicken manure substitution ratios on crop yield, N recovery efficiency (REN), soil N and soil organic matter contents, to clarify the optimal organic substitution ratio of N fertilizer under reduced N application (from 540 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) to 400 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Six substitution ratios were assessed: 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% under 200 kg N ha(-1) per crop season, respectively, plus a control with no N application from chemical fertilizer or chicken manure. Results showed that the highest yield was achieved under the 20% substitution ratio treatment, with 1.1% and 2.3% higher yield than chemical N alone in wheat season and maize seasons, respectively. At the chicken manure substitution ratios of 20% in wheat season and 20%-40% in maize season, the highest REN reached to 31.2% and 26.1%, respectively. Chicken manure application reduced soil residual inorganic N with increasing substitution ratio. All organic substitution treatments increased soil organic matter and total N content.

However, the mechanistic pathways by which organic substitution strategies regulate microbial resource utilization remain largely unexplored. This investigation examined the effects of organic fertilizer substitution on soil improvement and microbial community regulation in salinealkaline soils, with a specific focus on understanding the mechanistic linkages between nutrient regulation and microbial community composition. To address this, a three-year field experiment was conducted in an arid saline ecosystem of western China. Under a constant total N input of 320 kg N ha-1, four treatments with different organic N substitution rates of urea-N were designed: CK (100 % urea-N), OF40 (organic fertilizer substituting 40 % of the urea N), OF80 (organic fertilizer substituting 80 % of the urea N), and OF100 (organic fertilizer substituting 100 % of the urea N). Following three years of differential fertilization management, the results showed that OF40, OF80 and OF100 treatments significantly enhanced soil C and N contents in the topsoil (0-20 cm). Compared to CK, Organic substitution treatments (OF40-OF100) enhanced soil total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), and soil NH4+-N concentrations by 2.61-80.19 %. Conversely, soil available phosphorus (AP) and NO3--N concentrations decreased by 11.26-31.16 % across OF40-OF100 treatments compared to CK. Moreover, organic fertilizer substitution significantly altered the soil bacterial community composition, enriching the populations of Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota, while also significantly increasing soil fungal alpha diversity. Mantel analysis revealed significant correlations between soil nutrient status, microbial resource limitations (indicated by enzymatic stoichiometry), and community composition. Structural equation modeling revealed that organic fertilizer substitution reduced soil salinity and AP, while increasing SOC, thereby mediating microbial C and N resource limitations that subsequently affected bacterial communities. Simultaneously, it increased SOC and decreased soil mineral N, resulting in microbial C and N resource limitations that regulated fungal communities. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of soil amelioration processes and offer practical guidance for developing resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable fertilization strategies to improve soil quality and microbial functioning in saline-alkaline agroecosystems.","2025-07-01","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:39","2025-06-12","","","","316","","Agric.

However, how the permanganate oxidizable carbon fractions (KOCs) transformation affects SOC under OFS remains unknown. In this study, two typical farmland soils (grey desert soil, GS; meadow soil, MS) were selected for a 3-year field fertilization experiment (no fertilization, NF; synthetic fertilizer alone, SCF; and organic fertilizer substituted 20% synthetic N fertilizer, OFS). Field experiments conducted from 2018 to 2020 showed that SOC could be used to evaluate wheat yield and soil quality, so further study the effects of OFS on SOC and KOCs and their corresponding C pool management index (CPMIs). The results showed that OFS in GS and MS increased SOC (by 3.37%-15.62%, 4.92%-20.28%) and its fractions content (except low-activity KOC, LKOC) and CPMIs (except CPMI-L) year by year compared to SCF and NF. The recalcitrant organic C (ROC), KOC, high-activity KOC (HKOC), and medium-activity KOC (MKOC) were the key fractions affecting SOC. Moreover, HKOC and MKOC and their corresponding CPMIs (CPMI-H and CPMI-M) showed higher sensitivity. Structural equation modeling revealed that OFS in GS and MS increased SOC by increasing ROC and KOC (by regulating KOCs transformation) content, and increased CPMI-H and CPMI-M by increasing HKOC and MKOC content. Overall, the process of OFS promoted SOC sequestration and improved soil C pool in two soils were revealed from the perspective of KOCs transformation. Also, we proposed corresponding fertilization recommendations and showed that HKOC and MKOC could be used to evaluate and monitor soil quality and SOC. This study provides guidance for SOC sequestration, crop yield, and soil quality improvement in oasis wheat fields, contributing to the sustainable development of farmland.","2023-02","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:24","2023-01-19","","","","221","","Catena","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000907302100001","","","27 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effects of commercial organic fertilizer substitution (COFS) on soil quality and wheat yield, and the underlying mechanisms, are unknown. In this study, agricultural fields with low fertility (LF) and high (HF) fertility soils were selected for a two-year (2018-2019) field experiment in the oasis region of Northwest China. Three fertilization treatments with three replications (no fertilization, CK; local conventional chemical fertilizer application, LCF; and 20 % of inorganic nitrogen (N) was substituted by commercial organic fertilizer, COFS) were established to study the effects of COFS on wheat growth, yield, nutrient-use efficiency and soil quality. The results showed that compared with LCF in 2018 and 2019, COFS in LF and HF promoted wheat growth, improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), and increased yield (by 1.52%-3.05% and 1.16%-1.39 %) and soil quality (by 15.09%-28.63% and 22.53%-64.82%) by improving most soil indicators (e.g., soil organicmatter (SOM) and available nutrients). Moreover, SOMand available nutrients significantly affect soil quality and wheat yield, which canmonitor changes in soil quality and wheat yield. In conclusion, our study revealed that the mechanism of COFS in HF and LF increased wheat yield by improving soil quality. COFS is recommended for agricultural production, but its continuous application requires monitoring changes in SOM and available nutrients to adjust fertilization to guarantee soil quality and crop yield. This study provides guidance for the scientific application of COFS to improve farmland productivity and soil quality and helps to promote healthy and sustainable agricultural development.","2022-12-10","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:24","2023-03-30","","","","851","","Sci.

The substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer has been promoted to sustain crop yield and soil quality. However, knowledge gaps regarding the effects of organic substitution on soil quality and tea yield in tea plantations still exist. RESULTS A field experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of organic substitution treatments (i.e. 25% partial substitution: biogas slurry + green manure + formula fertilizer, BFG; sheep manure + formula fertilizer, OFF; 100% complete substitution: sheep manure + green manure, OG) on the soil quality, tea yield and quality, and nitrogen utilization efficiency in southwestern China. Results showed that all organic substitution treatments slightly increased soil pH, and significantly increased soil organic matter by 13.22-14.88% compared to conventional fertilization (CF). The BFG treatment was the most effective in enhancing the soil quality index, showing increases of 16.80%, 8.37% and 24.87% higher than the CF, OFF and OG treatments, respectively. Tea yield significantly increased under the BFG, OFF and OG treatments by 11.97%, 13.58% and 5.90% compared to CF, respectively. The BFG treatment increased the amino acid content by 7.78% and decreased the tea polyphenol/amino acid ratio by 6.87%. Additionally, the BFG, OFF and OG treatments greatly increased the nitrogen utilization efficiency of young sprouts by 70.71%, 82.54% and 34.28%, respectively.

However, it has been demonstrated that the long-term single application of chemical fertilizer will reduce soil nutrient content and the formation of soil aggregates, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of soil and agriculture. Many studies have shown that partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer can improve soil physicochemical properties and soil nutrient content. This study compared the effects of different organic materials as substitutes for chemical fertilizer. We partially replaced chemical fertilizer with rabbit manure, wine lees and rapeseed cake, amounting to 30% of the total annual nitrogen application in the field experiment, and we set nine different fertilization methods to assess and analyze the soil nutrient condition, aggregate stability and enzyme activity. The results showed that the experimental soil aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) were significantly increased compared with control (p < 0.05); the aforementioned fertilization methods also decreased the soil aggregate fractal dimension (D), disruption rate (PAD), average weight-specific surface area (MWSSA) and soil erodibility factor (K). The application of the fertilizer containing organic materials and microbial agent increased soil organic carbon (SOC) by 20.7% to 22.6% and total nitrogen (TN) by 34.6% to 38.1%; it also significantly promoted sucrase, urease and protease activities in all aggregate sizes (p < 0.05) and increased the 2-5 mm aggregate content. The correlation coefficients between the SOC and the enzyme activities were 0.18-0.95, and most of them showed an extremely significant positive correlation (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the application of fertilizers containing organic materials and microbial agents can improve soil aggregate stability, aggregate enzyme activity and soil structural stability.","2023-11","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:27","2023-12-23","","","22","12","","Plants-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001122574500001","","","10 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the environmental and agronomic benefits of liquid manure, such as biogas slurry, have rarely been comprehensively evaluated. To boost food production while maintaining environmental sustainability, a field experiment was performed to assess the effects of solid and liquid manure substitution for chemical fertilizer on direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC), grain yield, and carbon footprints (CF) in a rice-wheat system. The treatments involved only chemical fertilizer (NPK), 50 % NPK + 50 % pig manure (50 % PM), 100 % pig manure (100%PM), 50 % NPK + 50 % biogas slurry from PM (50 % PS), and 100 % biogas slurry from PM (100 % PS) in the circumstances of equal nitrogen fertilization. The results showed that rice CH4 emissions dominated the direct GHG emissions, and followed the order of 100%PM > 50%PM > 50%PS = NPK = 100%PS on average of three years. The 100%PM had the highest area-scaled CF with 11.84 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) due to high CH4 emissions and carbon emissions from pig manure production and compost indirectly without considering the changes in SOC stock. Meanwhile, 100%PM significantly increased SOC stock at 0-30 cm depth by 49.1 %, 11.8 %, 44.8 %, and 56.5 % compared with NPK, 50%PM, 50%PS, and 100%PS, respectively (P < 0.05). Notably, 100 % PM had the lowest area-scaled CF with 0.99 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) when considering the changes in SOC stock, followed by 50%PM. The 50%PM significantly increased the annual grain yield of rice and wheat from 2010 to 2018, with an average of 4.9 %, 4.5 %, and 5.7 % compared with NPK, 100%PM, and 100%PS, respectively (P < 0.05). Overall, although there was a trade-off between SOC sequestration and CH4 emissions under pig manure, pig manure substitution for chemical fertilizer significantly decreased yield-scaled CF, followed by biogas slurry substitution relative to NPK (P < 0.05). Thus, pig manure substitution for chemical fertilizer is recommended for environmental and yield benefits simultaneously considering the whole chain of production process in a rice-wheat system. In future, strategic fertilizer management based on PM and PS could potentially offer a sustainable solution to mitigate the trade-off and sustain the respective benefits of PM (i.e. SOC and grain yield) and PS (i.e. CH4 emissions).","2024-09","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:28","2024-07-31","1-11","","","49","","Sustainable Prod.

A thorough understanding of how such substitutions affect reactive N losses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in cereal production systems in the North China Plain (a main livestock production region in China), is needed to achieve an environmental friendly and sustainable production. Based on a long-term field experiment, different manure/chemical fertilizer treatments were designed, i.e., non-fertilization control (CK), chemical fertilizers alone (NPK), and manure substitution for chemical N fertilizers (with equivalent N rate; NPKP, 50% N from pig manure; NPKC, 50% N from chicken manure). Crop yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), soil fertility, N losses, and GHG emissions were chosen as prominent indicators to evaluate the consequences of manure substitutions for N-based fertilizers. The replacement of synthetic fertilizers by livestock manure decreased NO3-N leaching and NH3 volatilization by 46.2% and 5.61-22.2%, respectively, while sustained the crop yields and improved NUE. However, both NPKP and NPKC treatments did not have any impact on N2O and CO2 mitigation. Compared with NPK, NPKC and NPKP meaningfully increased SOC by 9.56% and 19.6%, respectively. More specifically, NPKC increased TN content by 14.7% (P = 0.05) compared to NPK treatment. The results showed that 50% substitution of manure for synthetic N fertilizers is a potential option inmaize production systems to decrease N losses (including NH3, N2O emissions and N leaching) by approximately 45% (42.8-48.1%). However, only 1.81% of the total farmers surveyed (i.e., 16,595) have being applied livestock manure for maize cultivation in the North China Plain. Therefore, famers in this plain should be encouraged to use manure to improve ecological aspects of cereal cultivation and decrease the associated environmental pollutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects, particularly under manure substitution regimes, remain elusive. Soils from different fertilization regimes [i.e., control, mineral NPK fertilization, and NPK with three manure substitution rates (30%, 50%, and 70%)] in a 33-year red paddy field experiment in southern China were sampled. The mean weight diameter (MWD) of soil aggregates and soil microbial properties (PLFAs), SOC content, and chemical composition of particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) under different treatments were determined to investigate the effects of manure substitution regimes on SOC quantity and quality. The results showed mineral NPK fertilization alone significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the MWD of soil aggregates by 14.4%, whereas 30%, 50%, and 70% manure replacement significantly (p < 0.05) increased the MWD by 12.0%, 19.9% and 27.2%, respectively. Compared to the mineral NPK fertilization regime, manure substitution practices continuously and significantly (p < 0.05) increased SOC along with its content in microbial biomass C and POC when the substitution rate of manure increased from 30% to 70%. Regardless of the substitution rates, manure substitution regimes decreased the O-alkyl C and aryl C proportions of POC, but increased the recalcitrant alkyl C resulting in higher alkyl C to O-alkyl C ratios compared with mineral NPK fertilization. Pearson analysis further showed that the O-alkyl C of POC were more associated with the soil microbial biomass C and N and total PLFAs. Partial least squares path modeling analysis indicated that microbial biomass C, POC, and MAOC were positive factors impacting SOC, whereas the promotion of manure substitution on SOC stabilization progressed mainly through increasing POC content. Our results suggested that substitution of 70% mineral N with manure N is the most effective fertilizer practice for improving POC-related SOC sequestration in rice paddy soil of subtropical regions.","2022-07","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:43","2022-05-25","","","","221","","Soil Tillage Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000793517800005","","","38 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We selected 80 European long-term field experiments that used bovine farmyard manure or bovine liquid slurry, alone (FYM and SLU) or combined with mineral fertilizers (FYMm and SLUm), and compared them to mineral fertilizer only reference treatments. We collected 5570 measurements from 107 papers. FYM produced slightly lower crop yields ( - 9.5%) when used alone and higher (+11.3%) yields when used in combination with N fertilizer (FYMm), compared to those obtained using mineral fertilizers only. Conditions promoting manure-N mineralization (lighter soil texture, warmer temperature, longer growing season, and shallower incorporation depth) significantly increased the effect of FYM/FYMm on crop yield and yield N. The production efficiency of FYM (yield:N applied ratio) was slightly lower than that of mineral fertilizers (-1.6%). The apparent N recoveries of FYM and FYMm were 59.3% and 78.7%, respectively, of mineral fertilizers. Manured soils had significantly higher C ( + 32.9% on average for FYM and FYMm) and N ( + 21.5%) concentrations. Compared to mineral fertilizers, yield was reduced by 9.1% with SLU, but not with SLUm. Influencing factors were similar to those of FYM/FYMm. Efficiency indicators indicated SLU (but not SLUm) was less effective than mineral fertilizers. Slurry significantly increased SOC (on average for SLU and SLUm by + 17.4%) and soil N ( + 15.7%) concentrations.

Crop straw and livestock manure, as the main by-products in agricultural production, are widely promoted to replace chemical fertilizer and improve soil quality to support agricultural sustainability. Aims We investigated the long-term effects of organic amendments and nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil quality, including the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content and soil aggregates distribution, and the dynamics of soil labile organic carbon (C) fractions and soil respiration, and crop yield. Methods A field experiment (started in 2009) with a winter-wheat and summer-maize rotation system was designed with four treatments: without fertilization (CK), with manure (M), with straw (S), and with straw plus N fertilizer (SN). The relevant indicators were measured after 10 years of annual fertilization in 2018. Results Compared to the CK treatment, M, S, and SN significantly enhanced soil organic carbon (SOC) by 190, 67, and 113%, respectively.

Changes in the total rice yield, yield components, absorption of nitrogen, soil pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, and soil bulk density under different fertilization treatments were analyzed. The results show that organic fertilizer replacement leads to a stable and high rice yield. The 9-year average rice yields of the CFR and DMR treatments were 60.0% and 61.5% higher than that of CK. The nitrogen uptake of the CFR and DMR treatments was also higher than that of the other treatments.

The integrated effects of amended composting manure with additives and a 50% substitution of chemical fertilizer nitrogen (N) input by amended manure N input to cropland were proved to halve ammonia (NH3) emissions from an integrate manure-cropland system. However, the accompanied impacts of these measures on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the integrate manure-cropland system have not been well quantified. Here, we examined the effects of improved manure storage and treatment and its usage at field on GHG emissions from a system perspective, based on a two-year experiment in the North China Plain (NCP). Manure storage and treatment included natural storage (NS) and composting with straw, with or without amendment by zeolite (Z) and superphosphate (SP). Manure products were applied as basal fertilizer for both crops. Results showed that CH4 was the dominant GHG source in the natural storage treatment, whereas N2O dominated in the manure composting treatments. Amending manure with straw, Z and SP stimulated 15-48 times N2O emission and decreased CH4 emissions by 82%-91% during storage and treatment. Replacement of 50% synthetic fertilizer N by manure N decreased total system GHG emissions by 25%-34%. Differences between composted manure treatments in total system GHG emissions were relatively small, although comparatively higher in amended manure treatments; however, they promoted greater soil organic carbon sink activity, resulting in no significant difference in net global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI). Application of amended manure produced high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the integrated crop-manure system.

However, the relationship between alterations in crop yield and soil microbial community in response to various substitution ratios is not comprehensively understood. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the impact of PSCFOF on soil nutrient supply, enzyme activity, bacterial and fungal community, and crop yield. Methods: An 11-year (2009 - 2021) field experiment was carried out in a winter wheat-summer maize doublecropping system with four fertilization regimes (no fertilizer, NF; pure chemical fertilizer, NPK; 30% organic substitution, NPKLM; and 50% organic substitution, NPKHM). Co-occurrence network analysis was applied to examine the importance of ecological clusters and keystone species in controlling microbial activities and crop yields. Results: There were no significant differences in soil nutrient contents and annual crop yield between the NPK and NPKLM treatments. However, the NPKHM treatment resulted in significant reductions in crop yield by 9.49%16.78%, despite increasing soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), and available phosphorus (AP) by 9.05%, 7.26%, 11.67%, and 26.62%, respectively. This contrasting effect was primarily attributed to the influence of a specific ecological cluster (module 2), rather than the entire microbial community. Long-term 50% organic substitution would suppress keystone species within module 2, such as Aggregatilinea, Luteimonas, Usitatibacter and Microvirga. These species were specifically correlated with soil carbon enzyme activities, including beta-glucosidase, invertase, and dehydrogenase, and contributed significantly and positively to crop yield. Conclusions: Organic substitution at different ratios altered soil nutrient content, enzyme activities and microbial community in different intensities and directions. Long-term 30% organic substitution could preserve soil fertility and microbial community, leading to stable crop yield; whereas 50% organic substitution could inhibit keystone species, reduce extracellular enzyme activity and ultimately lead to a decrease in crop yield. Implications: Our results highlight the importance of ecological clusters within soil microbial co-occurrence network in regulating crop yield, presenting a new perspective on the variations in crop yield resulting from varying ratios of organic substitution.","2024-02-01","2025-08-27 10:53:05","2025-08-27 10:53:47","2024-01-29","","","","306","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001146802600001","","","13 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study the effect of organic fertilizer on soil microbial carbon source utilization and bacterial community composition in the field of rain-fed wheat, we conducted a field experiment from 2016 to 2017 in a completely randomized block design with four treatments: the control with 100% NPK compound fertilizer (N: P2O5: K2O = 20:10:10) of 750 kg/ha (CK), a combination of 60% NPK compound fertilizer with organic fertilizer of 150 kg/ha (FO1), 300 kg/ha (FO2), and 450 kg/ha (FO3), respectively. We investigated the yield, soil property, the utilization of 31 carbon sources by soil microbes, soil bacterial community composition, and function prediction at the maturation stage. The results showed that (1) compared with CK, organic fertilizer substitution treatments improved ear number per hectare (13%-26%), grain numbers per spike (8%-14%), 1000-grain weight (7%-9%), and yield (3%-7%). Organic fertilizer substitution treatments increased the total nitrogen, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil organic matter contents by 26%, 102%, 12%, and 26%, respectively, compared with CK treatments. Organic fertilizer substitution treatments significantly advanced the partial productivity of fertilizers. (2) Carbohydrates and amino acids were found to be the most sensitive carbon sources for soil microorganisms in different treatments. Particularly for FO3 treatment, the utilization of & beta;-Methyl D-Glucoside, L-Asparagine acid, and glycogen by soil microorganisms was higher than other treatments and positively correlated with soil nutrients and wheat yield. (3) Compared with CK, organic fertilizer substitution treatments increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes and decreased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Interestingly, FO3 treatment improved the relative abundance of Nitrosovibrio, Kaistobacter, Balneimonas, Skermanella, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia belonging to Proteobacteria and significantly boosted the relative abundance of function gene K02433 [the aspartyl-tRNA (Asn)/glutamyl-tRNA (Gln)].

However, whether the combined application of the two measures can have an additive, antagonistic or no effect in reducing N-oxide emissions is unknown, especially in tropical-intensive vegetable fields. Utilizing a field experiment in typical tropical continuous and rotational vegetable cultivation systems, we examined how organic fertilizer substitution for mineral fertilizer accompanied by Bacillus velezensis SQR9 inoculation influenced N-oxide emissions, vegetable yields, and successive cropping obstacles. Partial substitution with organic fertilizer accompanied by Bacillus velezensis SQR9 inoculation increased vegetable yields based on alleviating the incidence of plant wilt and decreased N-oxide emissions by 11 % compared to the partial substitution and by 35 % compared to conventional mineral fertilizer. These inhibitory effects on soil N-oxide emissions may be mainly attributed to the increased abundance of nosZ genes and the key species enrichment in the bacterial co-occurrence networks related to N2O reduction (Desulfobacteroata and Verrucomicrobiota), and decreased in nirS genes. The stimulation of vegetable yield and the incidence of plant wilt suppression following organic substitution accompanied by Bacillus velezensis SQR9 inoculation was probably due to the promoted efficiency of N uptake and utilization by vegetables. Although the increased amount of organic fertilizer application was another strategy for stimulating vegetable yields and reducing the incidence of plant wilt, it also obviously stimulated soil N-oxide emissions. Rotational cropping improved vegetable yields while decreasing soil N-oxide emissions by 10 % when compared to the continuous cropping system. Overall, the work suggested that the combined application of organic fertilizers and PGPM may be an environment-friendly strategy for ensuring food security while mitigating N-oxide emissions in tropical-intensive vegetable fields.","2025-06-01","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:53:51","2025-03-01","","","","384","","Agric.

In this study, a 7-year field experiment was conducted to assess the impact of replacing synthetic fertilizer with manure on crop productivity, SOC sequestration, GHG emissions and crop CF under winter wheat-summer maize cropping system. Five treatments were involved: synthetic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer (NPK) and 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of manure replacing synthetic N (25%M, 50%M, 75%M, and 100%M). Compared with NPK treatment, 25%M and 50%M treatments maintained annual yield (winter wheat plus summer maize) and sustainable yield index (SYI), but 75%M and 100%M treatments significantly decreased annual yield, and 100%M treatment also significantly reduced annual SYI. The SOC content exhibited a significant increasing trend over years in all treatments. After 7 years, SOC storage in manure treatments increased by 3.06-11.82 Mg ha- 1 relative to NPK treatment. Manure treatments reduced annual GHG emissions by 14%-60% over NPK treatment. The CF of the cropping system ranged from 0.16 to 0.39 kg CO2 eq kg- 1 of grain without considering SOC sequestration, in which the CF of manure treatments lowered by 18%-58% relative to NPK treatment. When SOC sequestration was involved in, the CF varied from -0.39 to 0.37 kg CO2 eq kg- 1 of grain, manure treatments significantly reduced the CF by 22%-208% over NPK treatment.

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to address the effects of various fertilization practices on SOC changes in China's arable topsoil. The analysis was based on 148 peer reviewed articles reporting 69 sites and 729 observations with an average experimental duration of 18 years across China. We compared the response of SOC content to application of manure alone (M) or manure plus mineral fertilizers (NPKM) with the SOC response to NPK or no fertilizers (Control). We systematically analyzed how SOC responses were influenced by different environmental and management factors (land use, climate and soil properties, etc.). First, the retention coefficient of manure was used to present the percentage of C input from manure ""converted"" to SOC. Compared to Control, on average, manure had C-retention coefficients of 31% +/- 12% (95% Confidence Interval, CI) and 18% +/- 2% for the experimental duration of <= 10 years and > 10 years, respectively. When compared to NPK, manure had C-retention coefficients of 29% +/- 13% and 9% +/- 3% for the experimental duration of <= 10 years and > 10 years, respectively. In addition, compared to Control and NPK, application of manure increased SOC content by 0.23-0.26 and 0.18-0.19 g kg(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The results also indicated that the mean differences of SOC change between the treatments with or without manure application were mainly controlled by soil properties (28-43%) and anthropogenic farming practices (21-27%).

A 6-year field experiment was used to explore the mechanism of SOC storage under different ratios of manure substitution in northeast China, with treatments including chemical fertilizer application alone (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, NPK) and replacing 1/4 (1/4M), 2/4 (2/4M), 3/4 (3/4M), and 4/4 (4/4M) of chemical fertilizer N with manure N. Soil nutrients, enzymatic activity, and SOC fractions were analyzed to evaluate the effect of different manure substitution ratios on SOC storage. A high ratio of manure substitution (>1/4) significantly increased soil total N, total P, total K, and available nutrients (NO3--N, available P, and available K), and the 4/4M greatly decreased the C/N ratio compared to the NPK. Manure incorporation increased microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 18.3-53.0%. Treatments with 50%, 75%, and 100% manure substitution (2/4M, 3/4M, and 4/4M) enhanced bacterial necromass carbon (BNC), fungal necromass carbon (FNC), and total microbial necromass carbon (MNC) by 31.9-63.5%, 25.5-107.1%, and 27.4-94.2%, respectively, compared to the NPK treatment. Notably, the increase in FNC was greater than that of BNC as the manure substitution ratio increased. The increasing manure substitution significantly enhanced particulate organic C (POC) and total SOC but did not affect mineral-associated organic C (MAOC). High soil N and P supplies decreased leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) and alkaline phosphatase activities but increased the activity ratio of beta-glucosidase (BG)/(N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) + LAP). Treatments with 25% manure substitution (1/4M) maintained maize and soybean yield, but with increasing manure rate, the maize yield decreased gradually. Overall, the high ratio of manure substitution enhanced SOC storage via increasing POC and MNC, and decreasing the decomposition potential of manure C and soil C resulting from low N- and P-requiring enzyme activities under high nutrient supplies. This study provides empirical evidence that the rational substitution of chemical fertilizers with manure is an effective measure to improve the availability of nutrients, and its effect on increasing crop yields still needs to be continuously observed, which is still a beneficial choice for enhancing black soil fertility.","2025-07-03","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:53:55","2025-07-17","","","13","14","","Plants-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001527020200001","","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, the objective of this study was to analyze the effects of long-term organic substitution regimes on SOC sequestration, labile C fractions [particulate organic C (POC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic C (DOC), and readily oxidizable C (ROC)], SOC stability, the C pool management index (CMI), and vegetable yields in a long-term (13 years) open-field experiment. Five treatments were examined: 100% chemical nitrogen fertilizer (CN), substituting 25% of the chemical N with manure (MN) or straw (SN), and substituting 50% of the chemical N with manure (2MN) or manure plus straw (MSN). Compared to the CN, organic substitution treatments increased the average yields of vegetable, the SOC, the labile C fractions' contents, and the C pool management index (CMI) to varying degrees, but only MSN reached significant levels for these factors. However, the MSN treatment had a significantly lower C stability index (SI) than the CN. 13C-NMR analyses also confirmed that organic substitution treatments increased the proportion of O-alkyl C and the OA/A, but reduced SOC stability. Pearson correlation analysis and the partial least squares path model indicated that labile C fractions were the mainly direct contributors to yield and SOC stability.

To explore the effects of organic fertilizer on soil properties and bacterial community structure and diversity, a long-term field experiment (2011-2017) was conducted in a wheat-rice rotation system with four treatments: control (CK, no fertilizer), chemical fertilizer only (NPK), substitution of 50% of chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer with organic fertilizer (NPKM), and substitution of 100% of chemical N fertilizer with organic fertilizer (OM). Results showed that, crop yields (wheat and rice) from 2011-2017 were highest in NPKM. Combined with alpha-diversity analysis, long-term application of NPK led to a decrease in soil bacterial diversity. However, soil bacterial community richness (Ace and Chao1 indices) increased in NPKM in the wheat season, as well as in OM in the rice season. Compared with NPK, organic fertilizer inputs (NPKM and OM) increased microbial biomass carbon and abundance of dominant bacteria (Acidobacteria, Anaerolineaceae, and Nitrospira) in both crop seasons. In NPK, relative abundance of Rhodanobacter increased significantly in the wheat season because of low soil pH. Bacterial community composition and structure were similar between NPKM and OM in the wheat season. Redundancy analysis further found that soil pH (R2 = 0.735, P = 0.013) co-varied with the bacterial community structure in the wheat season. In the rice season, relative abundance of Nitrospira increased significantly in NPKM, which could generate large amounts of nitrate nitrogen (NO3- -N), and then increase risks of N2O emissions and NO3- -N leaching in paddies. Overall, partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer was optimal to increase crop yields and recover soil bacterial diversity in the wheat-rice rotation, and greater substitution with organic fertilizer in combination with chemical fertilizer is recommended only for rice seasons.","2022-02","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:53:57","2022-02-10","","","","133","","Eur.

Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the effect of chemical fertilizer reduction combined with organic materials in a wheat-maize rotation system from fluvo-aquic soil in North China on soil microbial community. The field experiment included five fertilization treatments, i.e., chemical fertilizer with conventional application rate (F), chemical fertilizer reduction on the basis of conventional fertilization (FR), chemical fertilizer reduction plus straw (FRS), chemical fertilizer reduction combined with organic fertilizer (FRO), and chemical fertilizer reduction combined with organic fertilizer and straw (FROS). The abundance, composition, diversity, and structure of bacterial and fungal communities among treatments were evaluated using qPCR and Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the concentrations of soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (TN) in all treatments with addition of organic materials were much higher than those in treatments applied with only chemical fertilizer. The SOM content in the FRS, FRO, and FROS treatments increased by 23.91%, 37.12%, 26.09%, and the TN content increased by 11.96%, 21.08%, 15.22% in comparison with the F treatment, respectively. The lowest contents of available phosphorus (AP) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) were observed in FR treatment. The AP content in FRO and FROS treatments were 2.44 times and 2.42 times greater than that in FR treatment, respectively. Compared with F treatment, the organic materials input significantly increased bacterial and fungal abundances. More significant effects on the alpha-diversity with organic fertilizer were observed in the fungal community compared with the bacterial community. The significant increase of Ascomycota and the decline of Mortierellomycota and Glomeromycota were observed in the combined with organic materials treated soils. The nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community structure in the F treatment was clearly separated from the other treatments, and the other treatments clustered closely, while with respect to fungal community structure, the FRO and FROS treatments grouped together and were separated from the other three treatments. The redundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that the structure of the bacterial community was significantly correlated with SOM and TN, and the fungal community structure was strongly correlated with AP, SOM, and TN. The chemical fertilizer reduction combined with organic fertilizer and straw can effectively improve soil fertility and nutrient availability, altered the community structure of both bacteria and fungi, but only significantly reduced fungal biodiversity.

Excessive fertilizer use in recent years has intensified these challenges, necessitating scientifically informed fertilization strategies to ensure agricultural sustainability. To identify optimal fertilization strategies for maize cultivation in Yunnan's red soil regions, this study conducted field experiments involving partial substitution of nitrogen fertilizer with organic manure to determine whether this approach improves soil health and boosts maize yield. Four treatments were compared in a randomized complete block design over one growing season: no fertilization (NF), soil testing and formula fertilization (STF), 15% organic fertilizer (swine manure) replacing nitrogen fertilizer (OF15), and 30% organic fertilizer replacing nitrogen fertilizer (OF30). The results indicated that substituting organic fertilizer for nitrogen fertilizer reduced soil acidification while increasing total phosphorus (TP) and available phosphorus (AP), thereby enhancing soil physicochemical properties. Maize grown under OF30 exhibited improved agronomic traits including plant height, stem diameter, ear height, and ear length. Additionally, the partial replacement of synthetic fertilizer with organic fertilizer notably increased maize yield and the weight of 100 grains, but there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) between OF15 and OF30. Moreover, the OF30 treatment generated the highest economic return of 25,981.73 CNY<middle dot>ha-1. Correlation and principal component analyses revealed that substituting organic fertilizer for nitrogen fertilizer notably influenced total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), and yield, with maize yield positively correlated with TP and AP content.

Reasonable organic fertiliser management practices have become the core of sustainable agriculture. However, it remains unclear how C-functional microorganisms affect SOC sequestration and decomposition in dry farmlands. In this study, we conducted an 8-year experiment on the Loess Plateau and used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the relationship between a subset of soil C-metabolising microbes and SOC accumulation under different proportions of organic fertiliser substituting chemical N (OFS), namely 25% (OFS25), 50% (OFS50), 75% (OFS75) and 100% (OFS100), and full inorganic N fertiliser (NPK). Compared with the NPK treatment, organic fertiliser substitution treatments significantly increased SOC by 3.9%-12.8%, dissolved organic C by 1.4%-3.5%, microbial biomass C by 9.2%-26.4% and particulate organic C (except OFS100) by 17.5%-33.0%, respectively. Moreover, the activities of alpha-1,4-glucosidase, beta-cellobiosidase (except OFS75), and sucrase were significantly enhanced by 36.6%-82.0%, 122.5%-209.5% and 11.8%-31.3% under organic fertiliser substitution treatments, compared with NPK. Metagenomic results revealed that OFS treatments significantly changed the diversity and structure of bacteria involved in expressing C degradation; however, they did not affect fungal communities. In addition, compared with NPK, different OFS treatments significantly changed the relative abundance of microbial functional genes involved in C degradation; that is, OFS25, OFS75 and OFS100 treatment increased the abundance of long-chain C decomposition functional genes by 4.8%, 6.1% and 6.1%, respectively. However, the OFS50, OFS75 and OFS100 treatments reduced the abundance of the recalcitrant C decomposition functional genes by 0.9%, 4.6% and 2.2%, respectively. Critically, PLS-PM revealed that extracellular enzyme activities of C hydrolysis and the abundance of C decomposition genes had a direct positive effect, among which genes involved in sugar and long-chain C decomposition had a positive loading coefficient and genes involved in recalcitrant C decomposition had a negative loading coefficient, except for the effects of organic fertiliser substitution and SOC fractions; meanwhile, C-functional bacteria had a significant negative indirect effect. Overall, this study demonstrated that organic fertiliser substitution enhanced abundances of genes associated with labile C decomposition and altered community structure and diversity of C metabolism bacteria, which collectively intensified extracellular enzymatic activities involved in carbon hydrolysis processes, thereby promoting SOC stabilization in dry farmland soils.","2025-06-25","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:54:08","2025-06-28","","","","","","Land Degrad.

However, rare research has studied the effects of partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic manure on soil bacterial community diversity and enzyme activity in maize field in the mountain red soil region of Yunnan.MethodsIn this study, four treatments were set up in which chemical fertilizer (the application rates of N, P2O5 and K2O were 240, 75 and 75 kg & BULL;ha-1, respectively) was substituted by 10% (M10), 20% (M20), 30% (M30) and 40% (M40) of organic manure with equal nitrogen, as well as two control treatments of single application of chemical fertilizer (M0) and no fertilization (CK). The maize (Zea mays L.) crop was sown as a test crop in May 2018. The effects of partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic manure on soil physicochemical properties, soil bacterial community diversity and enzyme activity were studied.ResultsThe activities of Cellulase (CBH), Invertase (INV) and & beta;-glucosidase (BG) increased with the increase of organic manure substitution ratio. The activities of & beta;-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), Urease (URE), and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) also had the same trend, but the highest activities were 159.92 mg & BULL;g-1 & BULL;h-1, 66.82 mg & BULL;g-1 & BULL;h-1 and 143.90 mg & BULL;g-1 & BULL;h-1 at 30% substitution ratio. Compared with CK and M0 treatments, Shannon index increased notably by 82.91%-116.74% and 92.42%-128.01%, respectively, at the organic manure substitution ratio ranging from 10% to 40%. Chao1 and ACE index increased significantly at the organic manure substitution ratio ranging from 10% to 30%. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all treatments, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria decreased as the organic manure substitution ratio increased. Redundancy analysis showed that microbial biomass C was the main factor affecting the bacterial community composition under partial replacement of chemical fertilizer treatment, while Actinobacteria was the main factor affecting the enzyme activity. In addition, the maize yield of M30 and M40 treatments was significantly higher than that of CK and M0-M20 treatments, and the yield of M30 treatment was the highest, reaching 7652.89 kg & BULL;ha-1.ConclusionTherefore, the partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic manure can improve soil biological characteristics, while increasing bacterial community diversity and soil enzyme activity. Therefore, a thirty percent organic manure substitution was determined as the optimal substitution ratio for maize farmland in the mountain red soil area of Yunnan, China.","2023-09-05","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:54:30","2023-10-08","","","","14","","Front.

However, our understanding of the effect of organic substitution on soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) in deep soil and its impact on crop productivity remains limited. Here we investigated OC and TN changes in soil profile down to 100 cm, crop yield, and sustainable yield index under synthetic nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium fertilizers (NPK), NPK plus straw (NPKS), and organic substitution (NPKM) treatments over two decades in four upland fields across different climate zones. Compared with the initial values, two decades of NPKM treatment significantly (p < 0.05) increased OC and TN stocks in either topsoil (by 25.6-103.8 and 15.8-89.8%) or deep soil (by 2.9-71.3 and 5.7-36.9%), respectively, across all sites. The increases in OC and TN stocks in 0-100 cm soil receiving NPKM were significantly higher than those receiving NPK at all sites and NPKS at three high-evaporation sites. Compared with NPKS and NPK treatments, crop yield and N uptake were significantly increased under NPKM treatment only at the Qiyang site. Furthermore, OC sequestration in the entire soil profile down to 100 cm and TN accumulation in topsoil exhibited significant positive correlations with crop N uptake, relative crop yield, and sustainable yield index. In conclusion, long-term partial substitution of synthetic N fertilizer with manure facilitates soil OC and TN sequestration in the entire 100 cm profile and thus maintains high crop productivity in upland areas.","2023-09","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:10","2023-10-06","","","9","13","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001073328900001","","","4 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

W.","A framework for determining the efficient combination of organic materials and mineral fertilizer applied in maize cropping","Field Crops Research","","0378-4290","10.1016/j.fcr.2011.06.018","","Application of organic manures and composts in crop production has been strongly encouraged in many places but often without due consideration to their quality and price. Since organic amendments can vary greatly in composition and mineralization rate, a framework is needed to make rational choices on their use as replacements of inorganic fertilizer, especially when considering poor quality organic materials. A field experiment was carried out with maize grown annually for 5 years on a Rhodic Kandiustox in Thailand to test response to mineral fertilizer (at 0-0 to 125-55 kg N-P ha(-1) yr(-1)), compost (0.59% N. 0.31% P and 0.55% K at 0-7500 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and stubble removal. The DSSAT model was calibrated to predict yields using the first year's trial data and then used to predict treatment yields for the following 4 years. The Seasonal Analysis module of DSSAT using Dominance Analysis showed that mineral fertilizer (125-55 kg N-P ha(-1) yr(-1)) with stubble return gave the highest net profit whereas the highest rate of compost without mineral fertilizer gave the biggest loss. The yield response was attributed primarily to N supply rather than P. Effects of compost, mineral fertilizer, stubble management, and their interactions on yield and profit were not related to bulk density or soil available water capacity even though soil organic matter (SOM) levels increased. With stubble return, the highest rate of mineral fertilizer increased SOM whereas with compost application or stubble removal it did not. The DSSAT simulation of yield indicated that the low quality compost would only be as profitable as mineral fertilizer if the N concentrations are 3-4 times higher than the present compost (1.8-2.4% N) or if the compost price is greatly reduced. The DSSAT yield simulation and Seasonal Analysis provided a framework whereby the suitability of compost as a N fertilizer replacement for maize could be determined based on its composition, rate of application and price. Further validation of this approach is needed where the organic amendments have significant effects on soil physical properties and where other nutrients besides N are a significant factor in the crop yield response.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different organic nitrogen substitution ratios for a chemical nitrogen fertilizer on the soil microbial community structure in cotton fields. A three-year field experiment was conducted in Changji, Xinjiang, China, with six treatments: no fertilization (CK), a single application of chemical fertilizer (CF), and organic nitrogen substituting for 25% (T1), 50% (T2), 75% (T3), and 100% (T4) of a chemical nitrogen fertilizer. High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the bacterial and fungal community structures. Results showed that organic substitution treatments significantly increased the bacterial Simpson and Shannon diversity indices compared to CK. At the phylum level, organic substitution treatments increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (1.27-22.44%), Gemmatimonadota (3.50-9.33%), and Actinobacteriota (17.25-38.57%) compared to CK. For fungi, organic substitution treatments improved the Simpson and Shannon indices, with the T2, T3, and T4 treatments showing significant increases. Organic substitution treatments increased the relative abundance of Ascomycota (2.05-14.75%), Basidiomycota (0.41-178.44%), and Glomeromycota (6.15-502.88%) compared to CK, while Rozellomycota was exclusively present in organic substitution treatments. Cotton yield data showed that the T1 treatment produced the highest seed cotton yield over the three-year study period, with significant increases of 6.19% compared to the CF treatment in the third year. These findings suggest that organic fertilizer substitution can effectively improve the soil microbial community structure and diversity, with moderate to high substitution ratios showing the most beneficial effects for maintaining soil health in cotton fields.","2025-06-25","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:42","2025-08-22","","","7","15","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001549318200001","","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different organic substitution proportions by using organic fertilizer made from agricultural wastes on saline-sodic soil properties and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) growth in an arid saline area. Additionally, the study tried to reveal the possible mechanism of organic substitution on soil quality improvement from soil structure. A two-year field experiment was conducted in the Hetao Irrigation District, northwest China during the sunflower growing season in 2019 and 2020. The study soil type is saline-sodic soil with ECe of 18.3 dS m(-1), pH of 8.3, and exchange sodium percentage (ESP) of 18 % in the 0-0.2 m soil layer, with a silt loam soil texture. Based on the recommended total N input (180 kg ha(-1)) for sunflower, four treatments were designed with three replicates: (i) CK (no fertilization), (ii) OF0 (chemical fertilization only), (iii) OF1 (organic fertilizer substituting 50 % of the urea N), and (iv) OF2 (organic fertilizer substituting 100 % of the urea N). Totally 12 plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design. The results showed that in the 0-0.4 m soil player, compared with OF0, OF1 and OF2 significantly decreased bulk density by 4 % and 6 %, respectively, and turbidity of soil suspension by 36 % and 66 %, respectively. Additionally, OF1 and OF2 significantly increased soil total porosity in 0-0.4 m soil player, mainly in macro-porosity (> 30 mu m) and mesoporosity (0.2-30 mu m), and increased soil water content compared with OF0 and CK. The improvement of soil structure was attributed to the amelioration of sodicity (reduction of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) or cation ratio of soil structural stability (CROSS)), and as its consequence, leaching of salt out of the surface layers. Furthermore, compared with OF0 and OF2, OF1 maintained a stable NO3-N supply and significantly increased agronomic efficiency of applied nitrogen by 29 % and 22 %, respectively. Moreover, OF1 on average significantly increased grain yield by 9 % and 8 %, crop water productivity by 12 % and 4 %, and net income by 7 % and 23 %, respectively. Mantel tests revealed that soil water content in the root zone and NO3-N concentration in the maturity stage were key indicators significantly affecting sunflower growth under the organic substitution. In conclusion, from the perspective of improving the soil properties, crop water-fertilizer productivity, and economic benefits, organic fertilizer substituting 50 % of the urea N was recommended for sunflower production under the arid saline environment.","2023-04-18","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:17","2023-08-12","","","","283","","Agric.

As an intensive form of agriculture, nutrient cycling induced by microbial activities in the greenhouses is relatively different from open fields in the same region. However, the responses of soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), enzyme activities, microbial community composition, and yield to organic amendment are not well understood. Therefore, a 5-year greenhouse tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill.)-cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) rotation experiment was conducted. The field experiment comprised 5 treatments: 4/4CN (CN, nitrogen in chemical fertilizer), 3/4CN+1/4MN (MN, nitrogen in pig manure), 2/4CN+2/4MN, 2/4CN+1/4 MN+1/4 SN (SN, nitrogen in corn straw) and 2/4CN+2/4SN. The amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O) were equal in the five treatments. Starting with the fourth growing season, the optimal yield was obtained from soil treated with straw. MBC, MBN, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, and enzyme activities were significantly changed by 5 years of substitution with organic amendments. Redundancy analysis showed that MBC accounts for 89.5 and 52.3% of the total enzyme activity and total community variability, respectively. The activities of phosphomonoesterase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and urease, and the relative abundances of fungi, actinomycetes, and Gram-negative bacteria were significantly and positively related to vegetable yields. Considering the effects of organic amendments on soil microbial characteristics and vegetable yield, 2/4CN+1/4MN+1/4SN can improve soil quality and maintain sustainable high yield in greenhouse vegetable production.","2018-06","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:59:40","2018-06-01","1432-1444","","6","17","","J.

The traditional fertilization system, with a single application of nitrogen fertilizer, while effective for crop yields, often leads to soil organic carbon (SOC) depletion, whereas green manure systems offer a dual benefit of nitrogen supply and SOC sequestration potential. However, the mechanisms by which green manure substitution enhances soil carbon sequestration (SCS) remain systematically underexplored in comparison to chemical fertilization. This review systematically examines (1) the mechanisms underlying SOC sequestration, (2) SOC losses associated with traditional fertilization practices, and (3) the theoretical foundation and practical applications of green manure as a nitrogen fertilizer substitute. We provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms through which green manure substitution drives SCS. Furthermore, we identify three critical areas for future investigation: (i) optimization of green manure management strategies to enhance SCS efficiency; (ii) comprehensive assessment of green manure's ecological benefits through long-term, multi-scale studies; and (iii) evaluation of green manure's climate change adaptation capacity and carbon sequestration potential across diverse climatic scenarios. These findings fundamentally advance our understanding of green manure's role in sustainable agriculture by establishing its dual function as both a nitrogen source and carbon sequestration driver. In addition, these insights have immediate relevance for agricultural policy and practice, particularly in regions where soil health and carbon storage are prioritized alongside crop yield.","2025-04-26","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:34","2025-05-31","","","5","15","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001495760500001","","","1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of chemical fertilizer substitution by Chinese milk vetch (MV) on the distribution and composition of organic carbon fractions in macroaggregates and microaggregates and SOC stability mechanism were investigated in paddy soils in southern China. Methods A 10-year (2008-2018) field experiment was conducted, including no fertilizer (CK), 100% NPK fertilizer (F100), MV with different percentages of chemical fertilizer (MV + F100, MV + F80, MV + F60 and MV + F40). The soil was separated into distinct organic carbon fractions using aggregate density fractionation and SOC chemical structure was analyzed by fourier-transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance. Results Chemical fertilizer substitution by MV increased SOC contents in the bulk soil by 9.1% (MV + F80), 5.8% (MV + F60), 17.9% (MV + F40) compared to F100. Organic carbon fraction mainly existed in mineral associated organic carbon (mSOC), accounting for 70.3-83.7% and 69.4-84.0% of the relative mass of macroaggregates and microaggregates, respectively. Compared to F100, aromatic C increased by 11.6% and 29.1% under MV + F60 within mSOC in macroaggregates and microaggregates. Within the mSOC in macroaggregates, compared to CK, MV + F80 and MV + F60 promoted the proportion of alkyl C by 9.6% and 6.7%, and decreased the content of O-alkyl C by 14.1% and 11.0%, respectively, which correspondingly increased alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratio. Conclusions Substitution of chemical fertilizer by MV (especially MV + F80 and MV + F60) improved the stability of SOC via increasing recalcitrant structure in mSOC, and was conducive to the sequestration of SOC in paddy soils.","2022-12","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:57","2022-09-06","641-659","","1-2","481","","Plant Soil","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000847966700002","","","19 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these organic amendments also effect the emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) from soil. Influence of different organic amendments on emissions of GHG from soil and their global warming potential (GWP) was studied in a field experiment in rice-wheat cropping system of Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP). There was 28% increase in CH4 emissions on addition of 25% N through Sesbania GM along with urea compared to urea alone. Substitution of 100% inorganic N by organic sources lead to a 60% increase in CH4 emissions. The carbon equivalent emission from rice-wheat systems varied between 3816 and 4886 kg C equivalent ha(-1) depending upon fertilizer and organic amendment. GWP of rice-wheat system increased by 28% on full substitution of organic N by chemical N. However, the C efficiency ratios of the GM and crop residue treatments were at par with the recommended inorganic fertilizer treatment. Thus use of organic amendments along with inorganic fertilizer increases the GWP of the rice-wheat system but may improve the soil fertility status without adversely affecting the C efficiency ratio.

The soil organic carbon content is considered an indicator of soil health. The evaluation of the methods to increase the soil organic carbon content in long-term experiments is usually carried out without considering its environmental effects, (e.g., CO2-C soil emission). This study hypothesized that sandy soils have a low carbon storage potential, and that the carbon accumulation in the soil is accompanied by increased CO2-C emissions into the atmosphere. The study was carried out as a long-term fertilization experiment in Central Poland using a rye monoculture. The changes in the soil organic carbon content (SOC), CO2-C emissions from soil, and plant yields were examined for two soil treatments: one treated only with mineral fertilizers (CaNPK) and one annually fertilized with manure (Ca + M). Over the 91 years of the experiment, the SOC content of the manure-fertilized treatment increased almost two-fold, reaching 10.625 g C kg(-1) in the topsoil, while the content of the SOC in the soil fertilized with CaNPK did not change (5.685 g C kg(-1) in the topsoil). Unlike mineral fertilization, soil manuring reduced the plant yields by approximately 15.5-28.3% and increased the CO2-C emissions from arable land. The CO2-C emissions of the manured soil (5365.0 and 5159.2 kg CO2-C ha(-1) in the first and second year of the study, respectively) were significantly higher (by 1431.9-2174.2 kg CO2-C ha(-1)) than those in the soils that only received mineral fertilizers (3933.1 and 2975.0 kg CO2-C ha(-1) in the first and second year of the study, respectively). The results from this experiment suggest that only long-term fertilization with manure might increase the carbon storage in the sandy soil, but it is also associated with higher CO2-C emissions into the atmosphere. The replacement of mineral fertilizers with manure, predicted as a result of rising mineral fertilizer prices, will make it challenging to achieve the ambitious European goal of carbon neutrality in agriculture. The increase in CO2-C emissions due to manure fertilization of loamy sand soil in Central Poland also suggests the need to research the emissivity of organic farming.","2023-04","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:26","2023-05-04","","","7","13","","Appl.

Using green manure to replace chemical fertilizers is one of the most effective solutions. To study the effect of green manure on the requirement for nitrogen fertilizer in oilseed rape, a field experiment with maize-oilseed rape rotation was conducted. Green manure was intercropped between rows of maize and returned after the maize harvest, with no green manure intercropped as control. Different nitrogen fertilizer treatments (0, 65%, 75% and 100% N rates, respectively) were applied during the oilseed rape season. The results showed that with a 35% reduction in nitrogen application rate, the rapeseed grain yield was significantly higher with the maize intercropping with green manure returned to the field than with the maize monocropping treatment at the same nitrogen level. Under conditions of intercropping and return of green manure, compared with the full standard rate of nitrogen fertilizer treatment, a reduction in nitrogen application of 25-30% in the rape season had no significant effect on rape yield. The agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer on oilseed rape increased significantly, by 47.61-121%, with green manure incorporation. In addition, green manure incorporation significantly increased the soil organic matter content and the soil-available nitrogen content when chemical nitrogen fertilization was abandoned. Benefit analysis showed that a 25-35% reduction in chemical nitrogen fertilizer applied to oilseed rape crops could be achieved by intercropping green manure in the maize season before the sowing of rapeseed in the experimental area. In the long-term, this measure would increase nitrogen utility, reduce production costs, and have concomitant environmental benefits of improving the quality of cultivated land.","2021-12","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:08","2022-01-09","","","12","10","","Plants-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000738125100001","","","10 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet few studies have evaluated these effects in a unified manner, limiting the comprehensive understanding of the impact of partial organic substitution on orchard sustainability.MethodsUsing an ecosystem service framework, this study assessed the economic benefits of provisioning (fruit production), regulating (soil carbon sequestration, fertility maintenance, and soil water conservation), and dis-services (N losses) in citrus orchards with a 6-year application of organic/green manure (OM/GM) accompanied by a 30% reduction in chemical nitrogen fertilizer inputs.ResultsCompared to conventional fertilizer application (CK), both OM and GM maintained citrus yield, improved fruit quality, and significantly increased the value of provisioning services by 36.6% and 26.8%, respectively. Cumulative N2O emissions, N losses via leaching and runoff were mitigated by partial organic substitution, and OM and GM decreased the value of ecosystem dis-services by 13.6% and 20.7% compared with CK, respectively. Regulating services constituted a relatively small portion of the net ecosystem services value, while GM showed the greatest promoting effect on it compared with other treatments, due to its remarkable role in increasing soil carbon sequestration. Overall, the net ecosystem services value of CK (93.7 x 103 CNY/ha) was significantly increased to 130.3 x 103 and 122.2 x 103 CNY/ha for OM and GM, respectively.ConclusionPartial organic substitution sustains ecosystem services and curbs dis-services, thereby highlighting its beneficial role in the sustainable development of citrus orchards.","2025-08-15","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:58","2025-08-19","","","","","","Plant Soil","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001549995600001","","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of combining chemical and bio-organic fertilizers on cauliflower yield, soil biochemical properties, and the bacterial community. Six treatments were established: no fertilizer (CK, control), chemical fertilizers (CF, conventional dosage for this region), balanced fertilization (BF, 30% reduction of chemical fertilizers), and balanced fertilization plus 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 kg.ha(-1) bio-organic fertilizer (Lvneng Ruiqi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Gansu, China) (BF + OF1, BF + OF2, BF + OF3, respectively). A two-season field experiment with cauliflower was conducted under the different fertilizer treatments in irrigation districts along the Yellow River, Northwest China. The results indicate that the yield, soil organic matter, total potassium content, and enzyme activity under the bio-organic treatments were generally higher than those under the CF treatment. Compared with the CF treatment, the BF treatment increased soil organic matter content, enzyme activity and soil bacterial relative abundance. Moreover, the bacterial alpha-diversity were higher than those of conventional fertilization. The predominant phyla, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi, were the main contributors to the microbiome shift, as demonstrated by their remarkable enrichment in the soil under BF + OF2 and BF + OF3 treatments. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analyses show significant correlations among the soil organic matter, available P and K, electrical conductivity, and relative abundance of potentially beneficial microbial groups, such as the genera Massilia, Bacillus, Lysobacter, and Nitrosospira. Overall, this study suggests that balanced fertilization and the application of bio-organic fertilizers are essential to ensure soil fertility and long-term sustainable green productivity.","2022-07-27","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:30","2022-08-19","","","","13","","Front.

However, the fate of chemical fertilizer N, particularly in long-term manure substitution treatment regimes, is not fully understood. The present study aimed to investigate the fate of 15N-labelled urea in a chemical fertilizer treatment (CF, 240 kg 15N ha-1) and N manure 50 % substitution treatment (1/2N + M, 120 kg 15N ha-1 + 120 kg manure N ha-1) in two continuous crop seasons, based on a 10-year long-term experiment in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that manure substitution greatly enhanced 15N use efficiency (15NUE) (39.9 % vs. 31.3 %) and suppressed 15N loss (6.9 % vs. 7.5 %) compared with the CF treatment in the first crop. However, the N2O emissions factor in the 1/ 2N + M treatment was increased by 0.1 % (0.5 kg 15N ha-1 for CF vs. 0.4 kg 15N ha-1 for 1/2N + M) compared with the CF treatment, although N leaching and NH3 volatilization rates decreased by 0.2 % (10.8 kg 15N ha-1 for CF vs. 5.1 kg 15N ha-1 for 1/2N + M) and 0.5 % (6.6 kg 15N ha-1 for CF vs. 2.8 kg 15N ha-1 for 1/2N + M), respectively. In which, only NH3 volatilization presented significantly difference between treatments. It is important to note that in the second crop, the residual 15N in soil (0-20 cm) remained mostly in the soil for the CF (79.1 %) and the 1/2N + M treatment (85.3 %), and contributed less to crop N uptake (3.3 % vs. 0.8 %) and leached losses (2.2 % vs. 0.6 %). This proved that manure substitution could enhance the stabilization of chemical N. These results suggested that long-term manure substitution effectively increases NUE, suppresses N loss, and improves N stabilization in soil, but negative impacts such as N2O emissions due to climate change should be investigated further.","2023-10-01","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:05","2023-07-21","","","","893","","Sci.

As a promising approach for achieving sustainable agriculture, partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer can affect the stoichiometric balance between organic C and inorganic N, thereby regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. However, the responses of soil N2O emissions and crop productivity to different ratios of organic fertilizer (OF) to synthetic fertilizer (SF) are still unclear, making the optimal fertilization scheme less accurate. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to measure soil properties, N2O emissions, and crop yields in a wheat-maize rotation system. Six fertilization managements were included: no fertilization (CK); total SF; and 15%, 30%, 45%, and 100% of organic substitution for synthetic fertilizers (LO, MO, HO, and OF), respectively. Compared to SF, soil annual cumulative N2O emissions in LO, MO, HO, and OF were significantly reduced by 16.2-20.5%, 28.9-33.9%, 33.2-42.2%, and 70.2-74.9% in two years, respectively. The mitigation of N2O emission with organic substitution was mainly attributed to the decreasing NO3 - and NH4+ contents and increasing soil pH. Meanwhile, soil organic C and total N were considerably higher in HO and OF than other treatments, with the lowest in CK in wheat season and in SF in maize season. Synthetic fertilizer and partial organic substitution increased the annual yield of wheat and maize compared with OF and CK in the first year, and HO increased the annual yield by 9.7% and 37.6% compared with SF and OF in the second year, respectively. The beneficial yield effects were mainly due to the enhanced synchronization of nutrient availability and soil fertility with partial organic substitution. Finally, the yield-scaled N2O emissions were reduced with increasing ratios of organic substitution in two years. Our study suggested that partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer, especially 45% organic substitution would be feasible fertilization strategy to improve soil fertility and crop productivity while mitigating N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation systems.","2024-03","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:48","2024-02-12","","","","154","","Eur.

Organic substitution ratio in 30% got a balance between stable vegetable productivity and maximum N reduction. However, higher substitution ratios decreased annual vegetable yield by 23.29-32.81%. Organic substitution (15-45%) improved soil fertility (12.18-19.94% increase in soil total organic carbon content) and such improvement was not obtained by higher substitution ratio. Soil mean enzyme activity was stable to organic substitution despite the activities of some selected enzymes changed (catalase, urease, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase). Organic substitution changed the species and functional structures rather than diversity of soil microbiome, and enriched the genes related to soil denitrification (including nirK, nirS, and nosZ). Besides, the 30% of organic substitution obviously enhanced soil microbial network complexity and this enhancement was mainly associated with altered soil pH.

Numerous attempts have been made to evaluate the influence of integrated nutrient management (INM) on both crop yields and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during a single crop growing season. However, few studies have quantified the impact across an entire rotation cycle in this cropping system, considering the CO2 uptake due to soil carbon (C) sequestration and saving of chemical fertilizer in INM practices. Therefore, the study was conducted to quantify the effects of 38 years of INM in rice-wheat cropping system on C sequestration and GHG emissions. Five treatment combinations of fertilizer nutrients (NPK) alone and their partial substitution (25 % N) with organic sources either through farmyard manure (FYM) or wheat cut straw (WCS) or green manuring (GM) in rice, and only chemical fertilizers at different levels in succeeding wheat crop were studied for two years (2019-20 and 2020-21). The results showed that substituting 25 % fertilizer N with organic materials (FYM/WCS/GM) in rice and using 25 % less NPK in wheat for 38 years significantly improved soil properties, including SOC sequestration, and increased crop yield (except WCS). INM increased the GHG emissions over chemical fertilization (100 % NPK), but the GHGI (greenhouse gas intensity) was equivalent, except for the usage of WCS in RWCS. Overall, in RWCS, INM via substituting 25 % fertilizer N with FYM/GM in rice and applying 75 % NPK in wheat had lower GHGI than only chemical fertilizer application, indicating the advantages of these amendments for increasing soil health, crop production, and climate change mitigation. Further research is required to determine the correlation between the mineralization patterns of added organic amendments, soil C fractions during critical crop growth stages, and GHG emissions.","2025-03-15","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:38","2025-02-20","","","","363","","Agric.

The use of large amounts of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer in rice fields results in low fertilizer use efficiency and high environmental pollution. Organic fertilizer is a promising way to improve soil quality and sustain high yields. However, most studies focus on the effect of animal-based organic fertilizers. The effects of different ratios of plantbased organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer on the grain yield and quality of colored rice have rarely been reported. Therefore, a two-year field experiment was conducted in 2020 and 2021 to study the effects of replacing inorganic N fertilizers with plant-based organic fertilizers on the yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and anthocyanin content of two colored rice varieties in a tropical region in China. The experimental treatments included no nitrogen fertilization (T1), 100% inorganic nitrogen fertilizer (T2), 30% inorganic nitrogen fertilizer substitution with plant-based organic fertilizer (T3), 60% inorganic nitrogen fertilizer substitution with plant-based organic fertilizer (T4), and 100% plantbased organic fertilizer (T5). The total nitrogen provided to all the treatments except T1 was the same at 120 kg ha-1. Our results showed that the T3 treatment enhanced the grain yield and anthocyanin content of colored rice by increasing nitrogen use efficiency compared with T2. On average, grain yields were increased by 9 and 8%, while the anthocyanin content increased by 16 and 10% in the two colored rice varieties under T3 across the two years, respectively, as compared with T2. Further study of the residual effect of partial substitution of inorganic fertilizers showed that the substitution of inorganic fertilizer with plant-based organic fertilizer improved the soil physiochemical properties, and thus increased the rice grain yield, in the subsequent seasons. The highest grain yield of the subsequent rice crop was observed under the T5 treatment. Our results suggested that the application of plantbased organic fertilizers can sustain the production of colored rice with high anthocyanin content in tropical regions, which is beneficial in reconciling the relationship between rice production and environmental protection.","2024-01","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:33","2024-02-27","93-107","","1","23","","J.

However, the impacts of incorporating CMV on CH4 and N2O emissions are still a subject of controversy. Therefore, we conducted a field experiment over three years to investigate emissions under different substitution ratios: urea only (CF); incorporating a traditional amount of CMV (MV); and with incorporation ratios of 1/3 (MV1/3), 2/3 (MV2/3), and 4/3 (MV4/3) of MV for partial urea substitution. Compared with CF, MV2/3, MV, and MV 4/3 resulted in increased yields. MV and MV4/3 reduced N2O emissions but increased CH4 emissions by 28.61% and 85.60% (2019), 32.38% and 103.19% (2020), and 28.86% and 102.98% (2021), respectively, resulting in an overall increase in total global warming potential (except for MV in 2021). MV2/3 exhibited a low greenhouse gas intensity value ranging from 0.46 to 0.47. Partial least-squares-path model results showed that CH4 and N2O emissions were influenced by substitution ratios, which indirectly regulated the gene abundances of mcrA and nosZ. Overall, the impact of CMV on CH4 and N2O emissions was determined by substitution ratios. MV2/3, which involved partial substitution of synthetic N fertilizer with 15.0 t ha(-1) of CMV, resulted in improved rice productivity without increasing CH4 and N2O emissions, making it a recommended approach in the study area.","2023-06","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:07","2023-07-07","","","6","13","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001016851900001","","","5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aims We investigated the effects of reduced nitrogen application with simultaneous full straw return on carbon input, aggregate size distribution, aggregate-associated organic carbon and total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, SOC fractions, and crop yield. Methods A long-term field experiment was performed in the dryland region of Guanzhong. The study involved three nitrogen fertilizer (NF) amounts: 337.5 (conventional NF, CNF), 286.4 (15%NF reduction, 15%RNF), and 236.3 (30%NF reduction, 30%RNF) kg N ha(-1) y(-1) with full straw return. Results Compared with CNF, 30%RNF increased the content of soil organic carbon by 5.7% and increased maize yield by 13.1%, under straw return conditions. The 30%RNF + straw application treatment promoted the formation of large macro-aggregates more effectively than CNF application. The 30%RNF + straw treatment significantly increased SOC by 10.6% and 4.7%, respectively, in large and small macroaggregates relative to conventional NF. Moreover, the 30%RNF + straw treatment resulted in a significant increase in the SOC content in the density fractions of mineral soil organic matter (mSOM) for both small and large macro-aggregates. This treatment also resulted in a significant increase in the content of TN in the mSOM and density fractions of particulate matter that had coarse and fine intra-aggregates of the large macro-aggregates. Conclusion Full straw return with reduced nitrogen (N) application could be a promising option to improve the structure of soil aggregates, soil organic carbon, and nitrogen sequestration.","2022-02","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:35","2021-11-26","87-97","","1","185","","J.

The field experiment was comprising four N fertilizer regimes such as i) single inorganic fertilizer with 800 kg N ha-1 (N800); ii) single inorganic fertilizer with 400 kg N ha-1 (N400); iii) inorganic and organic fertilizers each with 200 kg N ha-1 (N200+O200) as well as without N fertilizer treatment as control (CK). Data regarding the soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrate N (NO3--N), ammonium N (NH4+-N) and emissions of carbon oxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured. Organic fertilizer substitution (OFS) boosted SOC while decreased NO3 --N and NH4+-N concentrations. The cumulative CO2 emissions and emission factors (EFs) of N2O did not change significantly amongst fertilization strategies; however, as compared to N800, N400 and N200+O200 significantly reduced N2O emissions by 41.8%-45.7% and 43.5%-46.6% respectively. The NF was dominated by N residues (73.0%- 97.4%) and organic fertilizer (24.37%), with a significant difference detected between N400 and N200+N200 treatments. Meanwhile, compared to inorganic plots, OFS significantly reduced CF (345.9%-368.0%), which was influenced by SOC sequestration. The CF from N plots in apple orchard was dominated by fertilizer (21.7%- 39.6%), pesticides (4.3%-6.2%) and N2O (5.6%-11.8%). In addition, our results were further supported by a meta-analysis with 22 published studies, which showed that organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizer + organic fertilizer significantly reduced regional CF by 388.8% and 78.2%, respectively. However, regional NF ranged from 441.4 kg N-eq ha-1 to 453.9 kg N-eq ha-1, with no significant difference between fertilizer strategies. Therefore, reducing the amount of N fertilizer and partial OFS is a viable long-term strategy for mitigating climate change through C sequestration, reduction of N residues, and GHG mitigation, which could be beneficial to low C apple production in the Loess Plateau, China.","2023-08-10","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:25","2023-07-01","","","","413","","J.

Materials and methods The experiment included no fertilization (NF), chemical fertilizer only (CF100), and Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L.) incorporation with 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, and 0% of total N, P, and K supplied from chemical fertilizer (MVCF80, MVCF60, MVCF40, MVCF20, and MVCF0, respectively) treatments. The soil organic carbon fractions, soil nitrogen, and phosphorus fraction contents were measured over 6 years. Results and discussion In comparison with CF100 treatment, the MVCF80, MVCF60, and MVCF40 treatments significantly increased rice yield between 2013 and 2016, thus improving sustainability yield index. The soil organic carbon fractions increased 15-58%, 16-61%, 14-50%, and 12-33% in the MVCF80, MVCF60, MVCF40, and MVCF20 treatments, respectively, compared with the CF100 treatment (p < 0.05). The easily oxidizable nitrogen, acid hydrolysable pool II nitrogen, total nitrogen, NaOH extractable phosphorus, HCl extractable phosphorus, and total phosphorus contents in the MVCF40 treatment were 17%, 28%, 9%, 12%, 15%, and 8% higher than those in the CF100 treatment (p < 0.05). The MVCF60 and MVCF80 treatments further increased the contents of these nitrogen and phosphorus fractions compared with the CF100 treatment. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that the average yield was positively influenced by the contents of total phosphorus, easily oxidizable nitrogen, and dissolved organic nitrogen, and that the sustainability yield index was positively influenced by the contents of easily oxidizable carbon and total organic carbon.

According to the soil quality evaluation model, we observed that compost product application improved soil quality, wherein 40% compost product instead of nitrogen fertilizer showed a best effect on promoting soil quality. This was strongly related to microbial diversity and their network complexity. Also, compost product application shifted the composition of bacterial and fungal communities, significantly increasing relative abundances of dominant bacteria phyla (e.g. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota and Gemmatimonadota) and fungal phyla (e.g. Ascomycota), which indicated that compost product application facilitate the growth of microorganisms eutrophic taxa of microorganisms.

However, relatively few studies have investigated the association between soil physicochemical properties, denitrifier communities and N2O emission after short-term substitution of organic manure in vegetable fields. We conducted a short-term vegetable field experiment which included one control treatment (CT, no fertilizer) and three fertilization treatments containing equal amount of total N, phosphorus and potassium (CF, chemical fertilizer only; CMR, chemical fertilizer plus mushroom residue; COM, chemical fertilizer plus cattle manure). The results showed that partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic manure greatly increased cumulative N2O emissions, N2O emission factors and yield-scaled N2O emissions by 122-203%, 238-600% and 128-181%, respectively. Compared with the CF treatment, short-term substitution with organic manure reduced the abundance of nirS- and nosZ-type denitrifiers, and increased that of nirK-type denitrifiers. Modeling indicated that nirS abundance, together with soil available N, NIR activity, nirK abundance, SOC, NH4+, and NO3- were the primary factors associated with cumulative N2O emissions. The denitrifier community composition of the CFtreated soil was separated from that of soils treated with CMR and COM, and was primarily influenced by soil NH4+ concentration. NIR activity showed a significant correlation with denitrifier community composition. Overall, short-term substitution of chemical fertilizer with cattle manure (lower C/N ratio) reduced the abundance of nirS- and nosZ-type denitrifiers, but stimulated N2O emission.","2020-04-01","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:59:19","2020-03-24","","","","192","","Ecotoxicol.

However, the key mechanisms behind nutrient transformation and supply for stable crop yields are still not fully understood. Based on an 11-year field experiment with a wheat-maize rotation system, this study explored the advantages of combined straw and manure substitution under various organic substitution regimes. These regimes included an unfertilized control (CK), inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers (NPK), NPK substituted with straw (NPKS), NPK substituted with manure (NPKM), and NPK substituted with both straw and manure (NPKSM). Compared to NPK and NPKS, NPKM and NPKSM significantly improved wheat yield by 12.8% and 13.8%, respectively. Bulk soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), available superphosphate (AP), beta-glucosidase (beta G), urease (URE), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were all higher in the NPKM treatment than in the NPKSM treatment. However, compared to NPKM, NPKSM significantly decreased the potential nitrification rate by 31.0% and increased the soil NH4+-N content. Correspondingly, the functional genes of nitrification were also found to be decreased in the NPKSM treatment. In the rhizosphere, most soil factors increased compared to bulk soil, but treatment differences were smaller. However, the differences among treatments were reduced in the rhizosphere. The high amount of manure applied in the NPKM treatment caused excessive soil phosphorus accumulation, reaching over 46.7 mg/kg, resulting in lower N/P and C/P ratios. The soil quality index (SQI), based on soil nutrients, enzymes, functional genes, and C:N:P stoichiometry, was 9.9% higher in NPKSM than in NPKM. Bulk soil SQIs showed stronger correlations with wheat yields than rhizosphere SQIs, highlighting that bulk soil was superior to rhizosphere in predicting crop yield. Partial least squares path modeling showed that C/N, N/P, and C/P ratios strongly influenced SQIs. The NPKSM treatment, which improved soil nutrients, biological factors, and balanced C:N:P stoichiometry, is an effective strategy for sustainable agriculture. Future practices should focus on maintaining stoichiometric balance to sustain soil quality and crop yields.","2025-02","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:38","2025-03-03","","","4","15","","Agric.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001429928900001","","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that manure amendment would increase soil functional stability more effectively than mineral fertilization when soil nutrients were not limited. By using a 22-yr field experiment, the objectives were 1) to determine the effects of manure substitution and reduction of mineral fertilizers on soil physio-chemical properties, soil microbial community structure, and soil biological functional stability; 2) to isolate the effects of organic amendment from those of mineral fertilization on soil biologic functional stability; and 3) to elucidate the controlling mechanisms on the soil functional stability. Soils were sampled from the field treatments, no fertilization (CK), mineral N, P and K (NPK), two doses of NPK (2NPK), manure amendment (OM) and OM in combination with NPK (NPK OM). The nutrient inputs were similar in treatments OM and 2NPK. The functional stability was quantified by measuring the decomposition rate of crop litter added to the soils following Cu addition and heating. Soil nutrients, organic carbon and pH increased due to mineral fertilization and organic amendment. The principal component analysis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles demonstrated that the structure of soil microbial communities shifted between the mineral fertilized soils and manure-amended soils and the shifts were not due to nutrient limitation because the soil microbial communities were not separated between the treatments of NM and 2NPK. The manure amendment enhanced the resistance and resilience to Cu and heating more than the mineral fertilization, to a larger extent in treatment NPK + OM than in treatment OM. The resistance and resilience to Cu addition was positively correlated with soil organic matter, soil aggregate stability, while only the resistance to heating was positively correlated to soil aggregate stability. Moreover, the resistance and resilience were correlated with the shifts of functional and physiological structure of soil microbial communities due to long-term manure amendment and mineral fertilization. In conclusion, the partial substitution of mineral fertilizers with manure (NPK OM) increased soil functional stability to heavy metal pollution and global warming through altered structure and physiology of soil microbial communities due to improved soil aggregation with higher soil organic matter.

The partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic amendments may effectively address this problem; however, little is known about P speciation and transformation at the molecular scale. Here, we combined P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure, P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and chemical extraction to characterize P speciation and assess P leaching in a 10-year field experiment including chemical fertilizer (4CN) and replacement of half the chemical N fertilizer with manure (2CN+2 MN), straw (2CN+2SN), or combined manure and straw (2CN+1 MN+1SN) treatments. Compared to the 4CN treatment, organic substitution treatments resulted in 10.0-16.3% lower P accumulation and 57.3-102% higher organic P. Newberyite was detected in the organic substitution treatments, making up 6.9-13.0% of the total P, and the hydroxyapatite proportion was 7.3-15.6% lower than that in the 4CN treatment. Moreover, 2CN+2 MN treatment increased the orthophosphate diester content and labile P (Resin-P and NaHCO3-P) proportion, and 2CN+2SN treatment increased the orthophosphate monoester content and moderately labile P (NaOH-P) proportion. The 2CN+1 MN+1SN treatment exhibited the advantages of both manure and straw application. Partial least squares path modeling revealed that labile P was affected mainly by manure application and pH, and moderately labile P was influenced mainly by straw application and alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity. Compared with the 4CN treatment, the organic substitution treatments significantly decreased the total P leaching losses by 21.3-48.8%. Our results provide new insights into soil P transformation in response to different organic amendments. Combined manure, straw, and chemical fertilizer application (2CN+1 MN+1SN treatment) was a more effective practice for developing sustainable P management practices by comprehensively considering soil P transformation, vegetable yields, and environmental losses.","2021-12-10","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:52","2021-12-18","","","","327","","J.

We carried out a long-term field experiment in the northeast black soil region in China with four different fertilization practices: no fertilizer (CK), single chemical fertilizer (NPK), chemical fertilizer + straw (NPKJ), and chemical fertilizer + organic manure (NPKM). The content of particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), compound composition of SOM, carbon mineralization characteristics, active soil organic matter (ASOM), and inert soil organic matter (ISOM) were tested. The results showed that the application of fertilizers significantly increased the contents of POM and MAOM to 2.59-4.65 g kg(-1) and 32.69-34.65 g kg(-1) (p < 0.05), but decreased the MAOM/POM values by 37.8-42.4%, indicating reduced the physical stability of SOM. Fertilization practices increased the contents of aromatic, nitrogen-containing compounds and decreased the oxygen compounds of SOM, representing enhancement of the chemical stability. The contents of ASOM and ISOM increased in fertilization practices, while the biological stability index (BSI) under the NPKJ and NPKM treatments was lower than the CK treatment, suggesting that the biological stability decreased under the manure and straw application. In addition, the comprehensive stability of SOM increased by 26-116% through a reduction in the physical and biological stability, coupled with an increase in the chemical stability.

The performance parameters of crop and soil were examined after applying two different organic amendment treatments: the continual application of manure in each season (chemical fertilizer [CF] + manure), and one application of a large volume of peat and vermiculite (PV; CF + PV); controls received CF only. All three treatments were applied at an optimal N rate with high-yield management procedures. Treatments with organic soil amendments increased grain yields by 2.5-2.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared with CF alone. These high-yield plots had higher levels of soil organic carbon (65.3-111.0% higher), less bulk density (7.2-13.8% lower), and a larger proportion of macroaggregates in the topsoil. Compared with CF + manure treatment, the CF + PV produced similarly improved yields and soil properties, but the soil microbial biomass carbon and microbial community structure (including richness and diversity) differed between treatments. The recycling of organic materials was found to reduce farm profitability due to increases in material costs and labour. Our study provides an opportunity to increase both productivity and soil quality under integrated management, and the data will help adequately inform policies and strategic plans for food security and land use.","2020-05-30","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:59:16","2020-05-30","1125-1137","","9","31","","Land Degrad.

The soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC) were investigated every five years in a corn (Zea mays L.) cropping system with chemical fertilization and manuring over twenty-four years (1992-2016) in a semiarid area of northern China. There were four treatments with chemical fertilizer (i.e., N1P1, N2P2, N3P3, N4P4), three treatments with chemical fertilizer plus manure (i.e., N2P1M1, N3P2M3, N4P2M2), and one treatment with manure alone (i.e., M6), and an unfertilized treatment (control). The carbon sequestration rate (C-SR) and efficiency (C-SE) of SOC, POC, and LFOC were identified. The results revealed that the fertilization treatments (N2P2, N3P3, N2P1M1, N3P2M3, N4P2M2, and M6) promoted SOC sequestration, with a sequestration rate of 0.19 similar to 1.29 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). The excess application of chemical fertilizer caused a reduction in POC, whereas the application of NP, NPM or manure resulted in greater POC sequestration in soil, with a carbon sequestration rate of 0.04 similar to 0.24 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). The LFOC stocks were 1.43 similar to 2.24 Mg ha(-1) under the NP treatments, 2.47 similar to 6.68 Mg ha(-1) under the NPM treatments and 8.12 Mg ha(-1) under the M treatment; these stocks were all higher than that of the control treatment. Different fertilization strategies affected the pools of SOC with different sequestration rates. We found the carbon sequestration rates of SOC and LFOC were logarithmically correlated with the annual carbon input. When the annual C input is approximately 1.39 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), the SOC level will be maintained; when the annual C input is higher than 0.8 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), the LFOC level increases. This study describes the relationship between carbon inputs and the SOC(LFOC) sequestration rates under continuous fertilization in arid cropland. The results further evidence that the long-term fertilization of NPM and M increases the potential for SOC sequestration and quantifies the amount of exogenous carbon input required for soil organic matter enhancement.","2022-05","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:31","2022-05-31","","","9","14","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000799212800001","","","13 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A long-term field experiment (since 1983) comprising of 14 treatments with different combinations of inorganic (NPK) and organic fertilizers (such as farmyard manure, wheat cut straw andSesbania aculeateas green manure) was conducted to evaluate their effect on soil physico-chemical properties under a rice-wheat system. There was significant (P< .05) reduction in bulk density and soil strength but significant (P< .05) increase in infiltration rate and water retention with the use of organic manures along with chemical fertilizers. Organic C, nitrate-N, ammonical-N, and nutrient content were significantly (P< .05) higher in integrated nutrient management treated plots as compared to control. The highest carbon sequestration rate over the 3 decades was recorded in T-6, i.e., 50% recommended NPK dose through fertilizers + 50% N through FYM inkharifand 100% recommended NPK dose through fertilizers inrabi(0.29 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) as compared to chemically fertilized plots T-5, i.e., 100% recommended NPK dose through fertilizers (0.13 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). A positive and significant correlation was observed between organic carbon and soil physico-chemical properties barring bulk density, soil strength, pH, and electrical conductivity.

A four-year field experiment was conducted and included four treatments: (i) N0, no N fertilization application; (ii) NF, only synthetic N fertilizer application; (iii) 1/2OF, organic fertilizer substituted for 100% of the synthetic N fertilizer, with the total N application amount being equivalent to half that of NF; and (iv) 1/3OF + 2/3NF, organic fertilizer substituted for 1/3 of the synthetic N fertilizer with the total N application amount from organic and synthetic fertilizer being equivalent to that of NF. Soil total organic carbon (TOC), labile organic-carbon fractions (microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), and easily oxidized organic carbon (EOC)), the carbon pool management index (CPMI), soil aggregated distribution, and water-stable aggregate-associated organic carbon were determined. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to clarify the impact paths of TOC and garlic yield changes under different N fertilizer treatments. Results showed that compared with N0 and NF, 1/2OF and 1/3OF + 2/3NF significantly increased TOC contents by 14.1-20.6%. Soil MBC, DOC, and EOC under 1/2OF were significantly higher than under N0, whereas the 1/3OF + 2/3NF treatment had significantly greater POC. The CPMI was improved by organic fertilizer treatment, with 1/2OF treatment being significantly higher than N0 and NF. The proportion of soil aggregate mass with particle sizes >2 mm was significantly greater under N0, while 1/3OF + 2/3NF significantly increased the proportion of particle sizes of 0.5-2 mm. Soil water-stable aggregate-associated organic carbon showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, with the largest particle sizes being 1-2 mm. Moreover, organic fertilizer significantly increased soil water-stable aggregate organic carbon compared with N0 and NF. Similarly, the garlic yield increased with organic fertilizer treatment, while 1/3OF + 2/3NF significantly increased the yield by 37.2% and 15.3%, respectively, compared with N0 and NF. Furthermore, SEM analysis indicated that fertilizer regimes could directly affect TOC and labile organic carbon components by affecting aggregate-associated organic carbon. In particular, aggregates with particle sizes of 0.5-2 mm played an important role, indirectly affecting garlic yield and CPMI. These results indicate that organic fertilizer application has the potential to improve soil organic-carbon content and garlic yield; moreover, fully applying organic fertilizer can reduce N fertilizer input while still maintaining an increase in soil organic carbon and crop yield in the short term. However, caution is still needed regarding of the type and quantity of organic fertilizer added in different cropping systems, and with different soil textures.","2023-12","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:15","2024-01-07","","","12","13","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001132232600001","","","5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimized integration of both fertilizer types can reduce the chemical input while improving soil conditions. However, the specific impacts of combined organic and inorganic fertilization on soil quality and crop performance require further investigation. To address this, a two-year field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of varying ratios of organic fertilizer substitution on wheat growth, grain yield, nutrient uptake, and soil quality. The results showed that the application of a 100% organic fertilizer combined with a 90% chemical fertilizer significantly increased the wheat biomass and grain yield. In terms of the nutrient uptake efficiency, the aboveground uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) increased significantly by 29.2%, 29.0%, and 56.5%, respectively. The nutrient use efficiency was also improved, with increases of 30.4% for N, 21.1% for P, and 47.7% for K. The partial factor productivity, total nutrient uptake, and the translocation efficiency of N, P, and K were all significantly enhanced. The soil quality was also markedly improved, with increases in both the soil organic matter and nutrient content. In conclusion, substituting chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers improves the soil moisture and organic matter content, thereby enhancing the total uptake and translocation efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This leads to increased nutrient content in wheat grains, resulting in higher yields and improved grain quality. Moreover, this study provides practical guidance for wheat production and supports policy objectives related to sustainable agriculture, reduced chemical fertilizer use, and improved food security.","2025-06-16","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:42","2025-06-29","","","12","15","","Agric.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001515074800001","","","1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, how agricultural practices, especially the chemical fertilizer reduction and organic material application, influence soil bacterium-fungus-nematode networks remain unclear in wheat-maize rotation systems. Methods In the present study, a field experiment was established with five fertilization treatments, including chemical fertilizer with conventional application rate (F), chemical fertilizer reduction based on conventional fertilization (FR), chemical fertilizer reduction plus straw (FRS), chemical fertilizer reduction combined with organic fertilizer (FRO), and chemical fertilizer reduction combined with organic fertilizer and straw (FROS), under a wheat-maize rotation regime over a 4-year period. Co-occurrence network analysis was used to investigate the bacterium-fungus-nematode community relationships. Results The results showed that the kinless hubs assigned to Sordariomycetes, Agaricomycetes, and Dothideomycetes were of paramount significance to agricultural fertilization. Chemical fertilizer reduction combined with organic materials increased the total nodes, edges, and average degree (avgK), but decreased the average path distance (GD). The networks of bacterial metabolic pathway profile demonstrated that the edge numbers of FRS and FRO networks were obviously shorter than those of F and FR networks, but the GD showed an opposite phenomenon. In contrast, the FROS network had the highest edge number and shortest GD, producing a complicated co-occurrence network. Chemical fertilizer reduction with substitution by organic inputs significantly changed the fungal potential functions, and the genus Poaceascoma appeared to play a key part in shaping the fungal potential functions. Conclusion Overall, chemical fertilizer reduction and organic material application practices altered the responses of keystone taxa and topological features in the bacterium-fungus-nematode communities, such as increasing the scale of ecological network, complicating the relationship between species, and improving the efficiency of material, energy and information transfer between species. Furthermore, organic material substitution exhibited a greater influence on fungal functions, especially pathotrophic and saprotrophic fungi. The complicacy for the potential bacterial functions was weakened by separate application, however, strengthened by joint application of straw and organic fertilizer.","2022-04","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:30","2022-02-11","605-623","","1-2","473","","Plant Soil","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000751575500001","","","21 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between different types and proportions of organic fertilizers, soil moisture, organic fertilizer application rates, organic carbon molecular structure, and the soil environment in saline-alkali soils. Reducing the application of chemical fertilizers and substituting them with organic fertilizers can improve the soil quality of saline-alkali lands. The results indicated that replacing a part of the urea with organic fertilizer in saline-alkali farmland reduced the soil salinity by 11.1 to 22.8% in the 0-60 cm soil layer, decreased the soil pH by 0.11 to 1.52%, and increased the soil redox potential (Eh) values by 2.5 to 4.3% in the 0-20 cm layer of the mild and moderate saline-alkali soils. It also decreased the accumulation of the soil organic matter (OM) during the growing season. Compared to commercial organic fertilizers, natural organic fertilizers increased the accumulation of the soil soluble carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), resulting in less soil salinity accumulation. When commercial organic fertilizer was applied in a 1:1 ratio with inorganic fertilizer, the salt accumulation was minimized. Compared to conventional fertilization, organic fertilizer reduced the accumulation of the NH4+-N (ammonium nitrogen) and NO3--N (nitrate nitrogen) in the soil by 3.1 to 22.6%. In comparison to conventional chemical fertilizers, the application of organic fertilizer in the mild and moderate saline-alkali soils increased the accumulation of the DOC, DON, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and microbial quotient during the grain-filling stage. Specifically, it increased the DOC, DON, and DOC/DON by 12.7 to 26.7%, 12 to 59.3%, and 15.2 to 35.5%, respectively. The application of commercial organic fertilizer in the mild saline-alkali soils increased the MBC, MBN, MBC/SOC, and MBN/TN by 37.1, 65.6, 36.7, and 4.7%, respectively. Through analyzing the relative proportions of soil surface organic carbon functional groups during the grain filling period, we observed that, after the application of organic fertilizer, the OM in the mildly salinized soils primarily originated from terrestrial plant litter, whereas, in moderately salinized soils, the OM was mainly derived from microbial sources.","2024-10","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:45","2024-11-05","","","10","14","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001341924000001","","","8 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three improved N management practices (33% reduction in N applied (OU), OU combined with partial organic fertilizer substitution (UOM) and the urea in UOM amended with a urease inhibitor (ULOM)) together with no N application (CK) and farmers' conventional practice (CU) were tested on a maize-wheat rotation at Quzhou, Hebei, North China Plain (NCP). Nr emissions were related to WFPS (Water Filled Pore Space), soil mineral N (NH4+-N and NO3 -N) and soil temperature. Nr emissions and yield-scaled Nr emissions were significantly reduced by partial substitution of organic fertilizer for chemical fertilizer: NH3 emissions were reduced by 55.8-62.4%. Using a urease inhibitor (Limus (R)), further reduced NH3 emissions by 40.2-64.5%. Yield-scaled NH3 emissions were, on average, reduced by 60.0% and 55.2% in the maize and wheat growing season, respectively, relative to the UOM treatment. Long-term application of organic fertilizer had a significant positive effect on N use efficiency (NUE). Overall, the study shows that appropriated N management such as reducing the N application rate, partial substitution of chemical N by organic N and using a urease inhibitor can reduce Nr emissions and promote NUE in the North China Plain.

While adding high-quality organic resources combined with mineral fertilizer has been proposed to counteract this fertility loss, the long-term effectiveness and interactions with site properties still require more understanding. This study used repeated measurements over time to assess the effect of different quantities and qualities of organic resource addition combined with mineral nitrogen (N) on the change of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents over time (and SOC stocks in the year 2021) in four ongoing long-term experiments in Kenya. These experiments were established with identical treatments in moist to dry climates, on coarse to clayey soil textures, and have been conducted for at least 16 years. They received organic resources in quantities equivalent to 1.2 and 4 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the form of Tithonia diversifolia (high quality, fast turnover), Calliandra calothyrsus (high quality, intermediate turnover), Zea mays stover (low quality, fast turnover), sawdust (low quality, slow turnover) and local farmyard manure (variable quality, intermediate turnover). Furthermore, the addition of 240 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as mineral N fertilizer or no fertilizer was the split-plot treatment. At all four sites, a loss of SOC was predominantly observed, likely because the sites had been converted to cropland only a few decades before the start of the experiments. Across sites, the average decline of SOC content over 19 years in the 0 to 15 cm topsoil layer ranged from 42 % to 13 % of the initial SOC content for the control and the farmyard manure treatments at 4 t C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Adding Calliandra or Tithonia at 4 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) limited the loss of SOC contents to about 24 % of initial SOC, while the addition of sawdust, maize stover (in three of the four sites) and sole mineral N addition showed no significant reduction of SOC loss over the control. Site-specific analyses, however, did show that at the site with the lowest initial SOC content (about 6 g kg(-1)), the addition of 4 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) farmyard manure or Calliandra with mineral N led to a gain in SOC contents. The other sites lost SOC in all treatments, albeit at site-specific rates. While subsoil SOC stocks in 2021 were little affected by organic resource additions (no difference in three of the four sites), the topsoil SOC stocks corroborated the results obtained from the SOC content measurements (0-15 cm) over time. The relative annual change of SOC contents showed a higher site specificity in farmyard manure, Calliandra and Tithonia treatments than in the control treatment, suggesting that the drivers of site specificity in SOC buildup (soil mineralogy, soil texture, climate) need to be better understood for effective targeting management of organic resources. Farmyard manure showed the highest potential for reducing SOC losses, but the necessary quantities to build SOC are often not realistic for smallholder farmers in Africa. Therefore, additional agronomic interventions such as intercropping, crop rotations or the cultivation of crops with extended root systems are necessary to maintain or increase SOC.","2023-06-05","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:13","2023-06-20","301-323","","1","9","","Soil","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001004048900001","","","14 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study compared the effects of N fertilizer replaced by cow manure at 20.00% (CD20) and 50.00% (CD50) ratios on crop yield, on-field N2O, CH4 and CO2 emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, GHG emission intensity and carbon footprint (CF) and nitrogen footprint (NF) based on field research carried out for four consecutive cropping seasons during 2020-2021. The results showed that, compared with conventional nitrogen application (CK), CD20 could reduce N2O emissions by 6.65% and increase the SOC concentration by 48.08% when ensuring yield, although GHG emissions and intensity were both increased by 36.13%-36.44%. The CD50 lowered the crop yield 8.77% as the GHG emissions and intensity increased by 74.32%-74.58% at the same time compared to the CK, although the SOC concentration in farmland was significantly improved by 295.82% due to the higher substitution ratio of N fertilizer. Moreover, the CFs based on the area and yield of CD20 and CD50 were 23.22%- 135.52% lower than CK. The NF of CD20 based on area and yield was 10.81%-16.35% lower than that of CK, but the NF of CD50 based on area and yield was 4.82%-14.90% higher than that of CK. In conclusion, replacing 20% synthetic nitrogen with cow manure in sweet maize farmland in the Pearl River Delta could achieve the synergistic technical effects of maintaining crop yield, improving the soil carbon sink and decreasing GHG and RN emissions at the life cycle level. We suggest the application of this method as an alternative fertilization practice for realizing a sustainable sweet maize cultivation system in South China. This study provided a research basis for developing the sustainable sweet maize farming system in the Pearl River Delta in China. It would also provide valuable information for the development of clean agricultural production in typical subtropical area in East Asia.","2023-05-01","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:52","2023-03-31","","","","399","","J.

Bio-organic fertilizers (BOFs) including microbial inoculants and microalgae have garnered considerable attention as potential substitutes for chemical fertilizer to enhance yield. In this study, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of BOF partially substituting chemical fertilizer on the growth and quality of medicinal plant Polygala tenuifolia. The growth parameters, bioactive component contents, soil properties and composition of rhizosphere microorganisms were measured. The results indicated that substituting 40% of chemical fertilizer with microalgae showed the most pronounced growth-promoting effect, leading to a 29.30% increase in underground biomass and a 19.72% increase in 3,6'-disinapoylsucrose (DISS) content. Substituting 20% of chemical fertilizer with microalgae improved soil quality, significantly increasing soil organic matter content by 15.68% (p<0.05). Microalgae addition significantly affected the rhizosphere bacterial community composition of P. tenuifolia, reducing the relative abundance of Cladosporium by 33.33% and 57.93%, while increasing the relative abundance of Chloroflexi by 31.06% and 38.27%, under 20% and 40% chemical fertilizer reduction, respectively. The relative abundance of Chloroflexi positively correlated with both the underground biomass and DISS content (p<0.05), indicating that microalgae may stimulate Chloroflexi species associated with carbon cycling, thereby enhancing soil fertility, nutrient absorption, and ultimately leading to increased biomass accumulation and production of bioactive components in P. tenuifolia. In addition, there was no significant difference in underground growth and bioactive component contents between reduced chemical fertilizer dosage combined with solid microbial inoculant (SMI) and polyglutamic microbial inoculant (PMI), compared with 100% chemical fertilizer.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of various organic amendments and rotation systems on soil properties and sweet corn growth in sandy loam soil. A split-plot field experiment was conducted over 2 years, including rotations with or without Sesbania sesban as the main plot and six fertilizer treatments: a no fertilizer control, chemical fertilizer and four organic amendments as subplots. The cropping system did not significantly influence soil properties and sweet corn growth. However, the application of soybean meal, castor meal, cow dung compost and vermicompost resulted in sweet corn yields comparable to those achieved with the chemical fertilizer treatment. Notably, the soil organic matter (SOM) content was significantly higher in the cow dung compost and vermicompost treatments compared with both the no fertilizer and chemical fertilizer treatments. Moreover, these two amendments significantly increased soil carbon stock because of significant increases in labile organic carbon (TOC400) and residual oxidizable carbon (ROC) fractions in the maize field soil. A significant positive correlation was observed between fresh ear weight with husks and several soil parameters, including electrical conductivity, available P, exchangeable K and Zn, NO3-N, NH4-N, inorganic C and N, TOC400, ROC and SOM. In conclusion, cow dung compost and vermicompost not only result in sweet corn yields comparable to those from chemical fertilizer but also significantly enhance soil carbon stock by increasing TOC400 and ROC. Therefore, they can partially substitute for chemical fertilizers in promoting sustainable agricultural production of sweet corn.","2024-10","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:33","2024-10-29","","","4","40","","Soil Use Manage.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001337261900001","","","1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, long-term application of inorganic fertilizer with gravel and sand mulch could decrease the soil organic carbon content, and how to improve soil fertility under gravel and sand mulching remains largely unknown. Thus, we evaluated the effects of the application of inorganic (chemical) and organic (manure) fertilizers on the distribution of soil aggregates and their associated organic carbon in a field mulched with gravel and sand. A 5-year (2014-2018) field experiment was conducted in the arid region of northwestern China. Total organic carbon (TOC), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POC), TOC reserves in soil aggregates with different particle sizes, and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) productivity in gravel-mulched fields were analysed for the following six fertilization modes: no N fertilizer input as a control (CK), N fertilizer without organic fertilizer (CF), and organic fertilizer replacing 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of mineral nitrogen (recorded as OF-25%, OF-50%, OF-75% and OF-100%, respectively). The results showed that, higher manure to nitrogen fertilizer ratios were positively correlated with the percentage of soil macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm), mean weight diameter (MWD), TOC and POC concentrations, and their ratios in different particle sizes. Compared with CF, the treatments with 50% to 100% organic fertilizer significantly increased TOC storage (5.91-7.84%) in the soil profile (0-20 cm). Moreover, the CF treatment did not increase SOC concentrations or TOC storage, compared with CK. The fruit yield (2014-2018) of watermelon significantly increased by an average of 31.38% to 45.70% in the treatments with 50% to 100% organic fertilizer, respectively, compared with CF. Our results suggest that the partial replacement of chemical fertilizer with organic manure (OF-50%, OF-75% and OF-100%) could increase the proportion of macroaggregates, POC and TOC concentrations, and TOC stock in aggregates with different particle size and improve the yield of watermelon in the gravel fields of arid northwestern China mulched with gravel and sand.","2022-07-07","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:52","2022-07-18","","","1","12","","Sci.

An 11-year field experiment (22 cropping periods) was carried out to analyze the impacts of different partial substitution treatments on crop yields and the transformation of nitrogen fractions in greenhouse vegetable soil. Four treatments with equal N, P 2 O 5 , and K 2 O inputs were selected, including complete inorganic fertilizer N (CN), 50% inorganic fertilizer N plus 50% pig manure N (CPN), 50% inorganic fertilizer N plus 25% pig manure N and 25% corn straw N (CPSN), and 50% inorganic fertilizer N plus 50% corn straw N (CSN). Organic substitution treatments tended to increase crop yields since the 6th cropping period compared to the CN treatment. From the 8th to the 22nd cropping periods, the highest yields were observed in the CPSN treatment where yields were 7.5-11.1% greater than in CN treatment. After 11-year fertilization, compared to CN, organic substitution treatments significantly increased the concentrations of NO 3 - -N, NH 4 + -N, acid hydrolysis ammonium -N (AHAN), amino acid-N (AAN), amino sugar-N (ASN), and acid hydrolysis unknown-N (AHUN) in soil by 45.0-69.4, 32.8-58.1, 49.3-66.6, 62.0-69.5, 34.5-100.3, and 109.2-172.9%, respectively. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil C/N and OC concentration significantly affected the distribution of N fractions. The highest concentrations of NO 3 - -N, AHAN, AAN, AHUN were found in the CPSN treatment. Organic substitution treatments increased the activities of beta-glucosidase, beta-cellobiosidase, N-acetyl glucosamidase, L-aminopeptidase, and phosphatase in the soil. Organic substitution treatments reduced vector length and increased vector angle, indicating alleviation of constraints of C and N on soil microorganisms. Organic substitution treatments increased the total concentrations of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in the soil by 109.9- 205.3%, and increased the relative abundance of G + bacteria and fungi taxa, but decreased the relative abundance of G - bacteria, total bacteria, and actinomycetes. Overall, long-term organic substitution management increased soil OC concentration, C/N, and the microbial population, the latter in turn positively influenced soil enzyme activity. Enhanced microorganism numbers and enzyme activity enhanced soil N sequestration by transforming inorganic N to acid hydrolysis -N (AHN), and enhanced soil N supply capacity by activating non-acid hydrolysis -N (NAHN) to AHN, thus improving vegetable yield. Application of inorganic fertilizer, manure, and straw was a more effective fertilization model for achieving sustainable greenhouse vegetable production than application of inorganic fertilizer alone.","2024-06","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:50","2024-06-27","2083-2098","","6","23","","J.

The use of natural substitutes could overcome these drawbacks. We hypothesize that organic fertilizers could increase soil C, N sequestration and improve soil fertility more effectively than inorganic fertilizers, and that in particular effective microorganism (EM) could improve the effects of traditional compost. So, a long-term field experiment regarding improvement of soil fertility, protecting soil environment, and increasing of maize and wheat yield was conducted at China Agricultural University's Qu-Zhou experiment station since 1993. Field experiment included EM compost treatment, traditional compost treatment, chemical fertilizer treatment, and unfertilized treatment. Soil organic C (SOC), total N, nutrient concentrations, pH, bulk density, and crop yields were determined. The results revealed that long-term repeated application of EM compost promoted soil C and N sequestration, increased soil nutrient contents, decreased soil pH and bulk density, enhanced crop yields in contrast to chemical fertilizer and control treatment. Soil organic C stocks (0-20 cm) were increased by 87.32%, 81.51%, 33.05%, 25.20% and soil total N stocks were increased by 93.26%, 77.53%, 37.64%, 34.83% in contrast to initial values in EM compost, traditional compost, chemical fertilizer and control treatments, respectively. Moreover, maize grain yields in EM compost, traditional compost, and chemical fertilizer treatments were significantly increased by 163.49%, 128.34%, 62.36% compared with control treatment, respectively. The effect of increased soil C and N sequestration, improving soil fertility and enhanced crop yields in application of compost appending EM was better than alone application of compost.","2018-03","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:59:42","2018-12-28","13-22","","1","78","","Chil.

However, varying results were obtained on nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions as well as crop yields. Besides, in irrigated semi-arid croplands, drip fertigation has been suggested to be an effective practice for mitigating N2O and NO emissions while maintaining or enhancing agronomic performance. However, the promising combination of drip fertigation and organic fertilization remains poorly studied. By setting up melon (Cucumis melo L.) during 2022, and maize (Zea mays L.) during 2023, we aimed to evaluate the effect of different combinations of nitrogen (N) fertilizers: control without N fertilization, 100% of the N rate as solid manure (100OrM), 50% of the N rate as solid manure and 50% as urea (50OrM-50Syn), 50% of the N rate as solid manure and 50% as soluble organic (50OrM-50OrS), 100% of the N rate as urea (100Syn) and 100% of the N rate as soluble organic (100OrS). Urea and soluble organic fertilizers were supplied via drip fertigation. N-oxides (N2O and NO), methane (CH4) and ecosystem respiration (CO2) fluxes, mineral N (ammonium [NH4+] and nitrate [NO3-]), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and crop parameters were analysed. As regards N2O, no differences were observed between treatments in melon crop, whereas in maize crop, the cumulative emissions were the highest in 100OrM, followed by 50OrM-50Syn. Regarding NO cumulative emissions, in the melon crop were significantly lower in 50OrM-50Syn and 50OrM-50OrS between 34%-54%, compared with 100OrM and 100Syn. In the maize crop, the highest cumulative NO emission was also detected in solid manure treatment. The agronomic response of melon to N fertilization was only detected for total soluble solids (with maximum values in the 100Syn treatment). The combination of solid manure and top-dressing urea or soluble organic fertilizer prevented the penalties in N use efficiency, which were observed in 100Syn and 100OrS. Therefore, the combination of conventional solid manure at seeding and soluble organic fertilizer at dressing (applied by drip fertigation) was the most sustainable strategy from agronomic and environmental viewpoints in Mediterranean irrigated agroecosystems.","2024-10","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:24","2024-12-09","","","4","40","","Soil Use Manage.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001368770700001","","","2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A two-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the comprehensive impacts of organic fertilizer substitution in North China under a wheat-maize rotation. Four treatments were conducted: control (ZF), mineral fertilizer (MF), 50% nitrogen (N) mineral fertilizer substituted with organic fertilizer (MOF), and organic fertilizer (OF). Sulfonamide content, abundance of sulfonamide resistance (sul) genes, soil bacterial community, crop yield, and grain mineral elements were analyzed. Results showed that the MOF and OF treatments increased grain nutrients (phosphorus, potassium), and enriched sulfonamide residue and sul genes in soil. Additionally, the relative abundances of sul1 and sul2 in MOF and OF soils planted with maize were higher than in those planted with wheat. Compared to MF, the OF treatment decreased soil pH and crop yields but increased soil total nitrogen, phosphorus contents, and the abundance of Firmicutes. However, the MOF treatment significantly increased soil bacterial diversity and maintained yields of both wheat and maize. Increases in potential sul genes source bacteria (Planifilum), antibiotics, and soil nutrients accelerated the spread of sul genes in soil. Partial least squares path modeling analysis indicated that the soil bacterial diversity had a strong positive effect on maize yield. These results indicate that substitution of 50% N mineral fertilizer with organic fertilizer has the potential to benefit the stability and sustainability of the soil ecosystem, helping to meet the food demand in North China.

Here, a field experiment was conducted using a two-factor randomized block design (organic fertilizers and tillage practices) with five treatments. The results showed that the application of microbial fertilizers conserved soil heat and moisture, thereby significantly reducing CO2 emissions (6.9-18.9%) and those of N2O and CH4 fluxes during corn seasons, compared with chemical fertilizer application. Although deep tillage increased total CO2 emissions by 4.9-37.7%, it had no significant effect on N2O and CH4 emissions. Application of microbial organic fertilizer increased corn yield by 21.5%, but it had little effect on the yield of wheat. Overall, application of microbial fertilizers significantly reduced soil GHG emission and concurrently increased yield under various tillage practices in a short space of time. With this, it was critical that microbial fertilizer be carefully studied for application in wheat-corn cropping systems.","2022-07","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:36","2022-08-05","","","7","11","","Land","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000833303100001","","","24 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results In comparison to only mineral fertilization, the content of humic acid-C and humin-C was significantly increased by 58.8%-70.6% and 46.9-53.1% with organic fertilizer addition, respectively. The 2:1 type clay minerals (vermiculite and illite) were also increased, which were positively correlated with SOC storage due to the formation of clay minerals-humus complexes. Meanwhile, the abundance of Geobacter and Anaeromyxobacter was increased with organic fertilization, which accelerated the transformation of clay minerals by promoting Fe reduction, and then increased SOC storage. While, compared with NPKC1 treatment, more Gammaproteobacteria and Anaerolineae, involved in the decomposition of SOC, were found in NPKC2 treatment. Relative to NPK treatment, SOC storage of NPKC1 and NPKC2 treatments increased by 23.3% and 29.8%, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two treatments.Conclusions Therefore, appropriate addition of organic fertilizer is a better fertilization practice to promote stability and storage of SOC, which provided an important contribution to elucidate the role of mineral-microbial interactions for storage of SOC in saline-alkaline paddy soil.","2023-08","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:17","2023-05-21","465-481","","1-2","489","","Plant Soil","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000974555800001","","","14 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is limited information about the effect of the organic substitution ratio (OSR) on soil bacterial communities, which are considered as a good indicator of soil quality in a tea plantation. In this study, a long-term field experiment with six treatments was established to study the effect of different OSRs of N, from pure synthetic fertilization (NPK) to 100% N substituted with organic fertilizer (OM100), on tea yield and soil bacterial communities. The soil bacterial community composition was measured using a high-throughput sequencing technique. The results showed that as the OSR increased, the soil bacterial diversity increased and the community structure shifted significantly. However, 25% N substituted with organic fertilizer (OM25) produced the highest yield. Additionally, the soil pH and organic carbon (SOC) were the predominant soil characteristics that accounted for the soil bacterial community structural change. With more chemical N being substituted with organic fertilizer, the soil pH, available potassium, SOC, total N, and microbial biomass C and N, were elevated; however, the yield of fresh tea leaves decreased.

However, a clear understanding of NO emissions following long-term manure substitution is lacking. We hypothesize that soil conditions (particularly the accumulation of organic matter) following long-term manure substitution may stimulate NO emissions by providing more N substrates under favorable conditions. The primary aims of this study were to (1) quantify the long-term effects of manure substitution on NO emissions, and (2) identify the major regulating factors that contribute to the variations. Field measurements were conducted under summer maize-winter wheat rotations in a long-term fertilization experiment (since 1990) over three experimental years (from June 2016 to May 2019). The three treatments included an unfertilized control (CK), full synthetic urea in both crop seasons (NPK), and full synthetic urea in the maize season with 70% urea substituted by dairy manure in the winter wheat season (NPKM). Annual NO emissions varied from 0.10 to 0.22 kg N ha-1 and from 0.32 to 1.53 kg N ha-1 in CK and the fertilized treatments, respectively. We attributed the variations in annual NO emissions from the fertilized treatments to mean soil temperature by fitting a significant linear regression between the two variables (r2 = 0.681, p = 0.008). Seasonal NO emissions from NPKM treatment were lower (range, 2-66%, not always significant) and larger (range, 115-294%, not always significant) than those from NPK during the winter wheat and maize seasons, respectively. Annual NO emissions from NPKM treatment were 78% larger (range, 44-112%, not always significant) than those from NPK across the experimental years. Overall, this three-year field measurement revealed that cumulative NO emissions from NPKM treatment were significantly (p = 0.038) larger than those from NPK (2.73 versus 1.53 kg N ha-1). We concluded that long-term manure substitution for synthetic fertilizer in the winter wheat seasons did not mitigate, but rather stimulated cumulative NO emissions.","2022-07","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:56:17","2022-05-26","","","","221","","Soil Tillage Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000796614200003","","","2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organic amendment substitution (OAS) or farmland use change or can potentially enhance soil quality and crop yield. However, it remains unclear whether their combined application can improve the sustainability of wheat fields when changing from cotton and vegetable fields. In this study, continuous cropping cotton and vegetable fields were changed to wheat fields (C-W and V-W), and then field fertilization experiments (non-fertilization, NF; chemical fertilizer alone, CF; chemical fertilizer reduced by 20%, RF; and organic amendment substituted 20% of inorganic nitrogen, OAS) were conducted for three years (2018-2020) to explore their effects on wheat productivity and soil quality. The findings revealed that the combined farmland use change and fertilization improved soil quality in wheat fields compared to pre-change cotton and vegetable fields. OAS improved soil quality index (SQI-TDS by 0.36-0.82 and 0.32-0.82; SQI-IDS by 0.37-0.90 and 0.40-0.88) by improving soil properties and increasing microbial diversity compared to NF, CF and RF in C-W and V-W. Meanwhile, OAS increased nutrient use efficiency, crop productivity index (CPI, by 13.69%-72.46% and 8.52%-41.45%) and the sustainability index (SI, by 14.14%-49.35% and 12.56%-40.00%). Moreover, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (MBC and MBN), pH, available nitrogen (AN), soil organic carbon (SOC) and ACE index were key soil factors affecting yield. These indicators can be used to construct important dataset to simplify soil quality evaluation systems. Overall, the present study revealed the mechanism by which OAS improved wheat field sustainability by increasing wheat productivity and soil quality after farmland use changes, contributing to sustainable agricultural development. Moreover, it provides valuable reference methods and evaluation ideas for future research on farmland soil quality and sustainability evaluation.","2024-01-01","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:56","2023-11-10","","","","359","","Agric.

Partial replacement of mineral fertilizer (MF) with organic matter is considered a win-win approach for resource-saving and environmentally friendly rice production. Here, we examined the effects of reduced MF and in situ crop residue on the rice yield and soil fertility in the long term. A 27-year field experiment (a randomized block design with three replicates) in subtropical China was conducted to test the feasibility of the substitution in a double rice paddy ecosystem. The treatments were CT (no fertilizer application considered as control), NPK (mineral fertilizer N, P, and K), and RFC (reduced MF and in situ crop residue to supplement the reduced NPK dose). The crop residue included half of the rice straw and green manure contents, which were retained in situ in the RFC treatment. The RFC maintained the same rice yield and soil fertility levels as NPK. In general, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) content in RFC increased by 10.3%-20.8%, and 7.5%-28.0%, respectively, than that in NPK from the 5th to the 25th years. There was no significant difference in the content and net accumulation of SOC, TN, and TP and soil available nutrients between the RFC and NPK treatments after 25 years. The average annual yields were 9690 and 9872 kg ha(-1) for the NPK and RFC treatments, respectively. There was no difference in the yield of the first, second, and annual rice crops between RFC and NPK inmost years (six of the fifty-four seasons showed a significant difference). RFC increased the partial factor productivity (PFP), agronomic efficiency (AE) of MF, and yield stability (CV) (p < 0.05). Positive nutrient balance and a reduced loss of nutrients are evident reasons for achieving better indicators (PFP, AE, and CV) for nutrient compensation and organic nutrient utilization in the RFC treatment. The partial replacement of MF with in situ crop residue retention, is a simple and efficient way to maintain the soil fertility and rice yield as NPK in southern China. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, data on the mechanism of yield sustainability response to manure substitution is limited. We quantitatively studied yield sustainability through soil nutrients' stoichiometry, carbon (C) sequestration, and apparent phosphorus (P) balance in a 35-year long-term trial under double rice cropping pattern in Southern China. The study consisted of five treatments: CK (control), NPK (chemical nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers), NPKM1 (30% manure; 70% chemical NPK fertilizers), NPKM2 (50% manure; 50% chemical NPK fertilizers), and NPKM3 (70% manure; 30% chemical NPK fertilizers). The combined treatments increased yield trend, sustainability index (SYI), C sequestration, P uptake, and sensitivity index, but had little effect on the coefficient of variation of the crop yield compared with the NPK treatment. The apparent P balance in fertilizer treatments has exceeded the environmental risk threshold of 35 kg ha(-1) year(-1). The path analysis showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) directly affected total P (TP), while SOC and TP indirectly affected yield by directly changing soil C:N:P stoichiometry. The critical values of C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios above which SYI declined were 10.8, 23.0, and 1.7, respectively. We concluded that organic amendment substitution had significant effect on yield sustainability and C sequestration, functioned as a C-sink, and revealed potential for P buildup. Therefore, substitution of chemical fertilizers by manure should be done with caution to avert excess P accumulation and loss to the environment. Also, the critical values of soil C:N:P stoichiometric ratios should be taken into cognizance during paddy soil management.","2022-12","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:58:36","2022-10-21","4282-4298","","4","22","","J.

In this study, the changes in microbial necromass carbon (MNC), lignin phenols, and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), as well as soil microbial life history strategy were determined in a 16-year field experiment in response to different fertilization regimes, including a no-fertilizer control (C), conventional chemical NPK fertilization (NPK), and partial substitutions of the NPK in chemical fertilizers with a low (30 %) or high (60 %) level of straw (0.3S and 0.6S) or cattle manure (0.3M and 0.6M). The results showed that total lignin phenol content and its contribution to SOC were significantly increased by 88.7 % and 74.2 %, respectively, in high-level straw substitution treatment as compared to chemical fertilization. Both high-level straw and cattle manure substitution increased MNC and total GRSP contents, but did not alter their contributions to SOC compared to chemical fertilization. In fertilized treatments, the high-level cattle manure substitution had the lowest and highest bacterial and fungal K/r ratio, respectively. Bacterial K/r ratio was an important factor in predicting bacterial necromass carbon content and there was a significant negative correlation between them. The ratio of ectomycorrhizal to saprotrophic fungi and fungal diversity were important factors for predicting lignin phenol and GRSP contents, respectively. In addition, the SEMs modeling indicated that straw substitution directly affected lignin phenol and MNC accumulation, whereas cattle manure substitution indirectly affected MNC accumulation by affecting microbial life history strategies. In conclusions, agricultural residues inputs support the formation of a multiple carbon pool of SOC compared to chemical fertilization; and microbial life history strategy is an important driver of SOC formation and affects SOC accumulation and stability in agroecosystems.","2024-06-01","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:57:54","2024-06-08","","","","927","","Sci.

In a field experiment, we investigated the effect of cropping history (grazed unfertilized grass-clover and fertilized [300 kg N per hectare] ryegrass, proportion of grassland and previous fertilizer use) on crop growth and nitrate leaching for 2 years following grassland cultivation. In the final year, the effect of perennial ryegrass as a catch crop was investigated. The nitrogen fertilizer replacement value (NFRV) of grassland cultivation was higher at 132 kg N per hectare in the rotation with 75% grassland compared with on average 111 kg N per hectare in rotations with 25 and 38% grassland and the NFRV of ryegrass in the rotation was higher than that of grass-clover. Nitrate leaching following cultivation was not affected by the proportion of grassland in the crop rotation or sward type. However, there was a considerable effect of having a ryegrass catch crop following the final barley crop as nitrate leaching was reduced from 60 to 9 kg N per hectare. When summarizing results from the crop rotations over a longer period (1997-2005), management strategy adopted in both the grassland and arable phases appeared to be the primary instrument in avoiding nutrient losses from mixed crop rotations, irrespective of grass proportion. In the arable phase, the huge potential of catch crops has been demonstrated, but it is also important to realize that all parts of the grass-arable crop rotations must be considered potentially leaky.","2008-12","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 11:00:04","2008-12-01","373-382","","4","24","","Soil Use Manage.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000261108800008","","","44 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving edge-based road condition monitoring (LPE-RCM) scheme. To reduce the burden of the TA, we use edge nodes to filter out redundant road conditions. Besides, to encourage the vehicle to report road conditions actively, we adopt a privacy-aware reputation mechanism.

Based on the limitations of land resources, it is important to explore a sustainable and effective fertilization strategy to reduce risks and ensure there is a high yield of grain and sustainable development of agriculture. Soil fertility underpins cultivated land, which is the most important resource of agricultural production, and is also the key for maintaining agricultural sustainability. The central elements of soil fertility are soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (SN). This study applied the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer-Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) and the CENTURY-based soil module to simulate the trends of crop yields, SN storages and SOC storages until the end of this century under different climate change circumstances, based on a 36-year long-term experiment established at Shenyang site, China. Four fertilizer practices were applied: control (CK), combined chemical fertilizer of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), NPK with manure (MNPK), and NPK fertilizers plus a high application rate of manure (hMNPK). The outcomes indicated that the DSSAT model can fully simulate the yields of maize and soybean as well as the dynamic stocks of the SN and SOC. Three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) for future development were chosen from the fifth assessment report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Moreover, a baseline was installed. Crop yields, SN, and SOC storages from 2016 to 2100 were estimated under four climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, and Baseline). The RCP scenarios in some treatments reduced SN and SOC stocks and maize yield, and had no effect on soybean yield. However, the application of NPK with manure could improve crop yields, while it increased SN and SOC storages substantially. To some extent, the negative effects of climate scenarios could be mitigated by applying manure. In the RCP 4.5, maize yields of NPK, MNPK, and hMNPK treatments declined by 14.8%, 7.7%, and 6.2%, respectively, compared with that of NPK under Baseline. The NPK fertilizers plus manure treatments could cut the reduction of maize yield caused by climate change in half. Additionally, the SOC storage and SN of chemical fertilizers plus manure treatments under RCP scenarios increased by 20.2%-33.5% and 13.7%-21.7% compared with that of NPK under baseline, respectively. It was concluded that a rational combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer applications is a sustainable and effective agricultural measure to maintain food security and relieve environmental stresses.","2020-03-02","2025-08-27 10:53:06","2025-08-27 10:59:14","2020-03-02","","","6","12","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000523751400041","","","19 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The validated model accurately simulates water and nitrogen migration, predicting nitrogen leaching dynamics. Compared to chemical fertilizer treatment, differences in soil hydraulic parameters under biogas slurry drip irrigation impact moisture and nitrate nitrogen distribution.

Identification of sensitive indicators and developing metrics to assess SOM quality is a major challenge under field conditions.Methods: Data from a continuing long-term experiment since 2005 at Modipuram, India, were analyzed with key objectives to 1) observe the long-term effect of vermicompost/crop residues alone or in conjunction with NPK chemical fertilizers on crop yield and quality of SOM, 2) identify and develop SOM quality indicators (SOMQI) by encompassing sensitive indicators, and 3) predict system productivity by using SOMQI under rice (Oryza sativa L.)-potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (RPW) and maize (Zea mays L.)-potato-onion (Allium cepa L.) (MPO) cropping systems. The treatments comprised of 100% NPK fertilizer; 100% N from vermicompost (N-VC); 50% NPK from fertilizer + 50% N from VC; 100% NPK from fertilizer + crop residue (CR); 100% N from VC + CR.Results: Results showed that continuous application of 100% N-VC and 100% N-VC+CR for eight years considerably increased the soil's particulate organic matter carbon (POM-C), light fraction organic matter carbon (LFOM-C), and nitrogen (LFOM-N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), as well as the available N (AN), available P (AP) and available S (AS) over control. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified AN, POM-C, LFOM-C: N, and DON in RPW and AN, POM-C, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and LFOM-C: N in MPO cropping system as sensitive SOM quality indicators for the development of SOMQI. Under the MPO cropping system, results were more pronounced with 100% N-VC and 50% NPK+50% N-VC at 0-15 cm soil depth. Furthermore, at 15-30 cm depth, the effect was more prominent in 100% NPK + CR over other treatments.Discussion: Overall MPO cropping system exhibited better SOMQI than the RPW system. Rice, wheat, and maize yields increased significantly under different fertilizer treatments with organic or inorganic amendments. Substitution of fertilizer N with organic sources showed comparable yields obtained under 100% NPK treatment. Partial substitution of chemical fertilizers either by VC and/or CR enhanced the SOM quality and productivity under both cropping systems. The use of PCA-based SOMQI can be helpful in assessing SOM quality and predicting the productivity of cropping systems.","2023-05-12","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:09","2023-06-09","","","","11","","Front.

The efficient use of nutrients in arable farmlands is very vital to this endeavor. It minimizes fertilizer input and adverse soil and environmental implications that may arise from the incremental use of fertilizers. It is understood that enhancing the natural capacity of the soil (i.e., the soil's physical, chemical, and biological quality), may effectively improve soil nutrient dynamics, availability, and efficient use by crops. The adoption of integrated nutrient management (INM) approaches such as the organic amendment of the soil in addition to fertilizer use has shown positive impacts on maintaining and recovering soil quality, hence lowering excessive fertilizer use in farmlands. Therefore, this review contextualized the effect of compost and fertilizer on nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and productivity of broadacre crops. The use of compost as an organic soil amendment material has shown some inherently unique advantages and beneficial impacts on soil health and fertility such as improved soil structure, nutrient retention, mobilization, and bioavailability. Several studies have explored these comparative advantages by either blending compost with chemical fertilizer before soil application or a co-application and have noted the observed amelioration of unfavorable soil conditions such as low porosity, high bulk density, low organic matter (OM), unfavorable pH, and cation exchange capacity (CEC), low biological activities with different doses of compost. Consequently, the co-utilization of composts and chemical fertilizers may become viable substitutes for chemical fertilizers in maintaining soil fertility, improving NUE, and crop yield in farm -lands. The review further described the comparative environmental and economic implications of adopting the combined utilization of compost and fertilizers in farmlands.","2022-09-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:16","2022-06-22","","","","317","","J.

Literature synthesis identified 180 kg ha-1 as the optimal N rate for 95% yield potential. Deep placement, compared to surface broadcasting, enhanced yield by 2.6% and reduced N2O by 15.3% in field trials, with meta-analysis showing substantial suppression of NH3 (80.5%) and N2O (12.5%). Manure substitution exhibited limited benefits for yield enhancement and N2O mitigation but demonstrated specific efficacy in medium- and coarse-textured soils with low soil organic carbon. Urea plus controlled-release urea performed best from meta-analysis yet its benefit diminished under high rainfall. Urea-nitrification inhibitor blends led to 5.9% higher NH3 and urea-urease inhibitors exerted limited mitigation efficacy on N2O production from field data, with meta-results confirming the risk of urease inhibitors in stimulating NH3. Dual inhibitors worked synergistically to sustain yields and alleviate N losses, especially in alkaline and coarse soils.CONCLUSIONThe combination of using controlled-release fertilizer plus traditional urea mixed with dual inhibitors and deep placement would be an enhanced approach across Chinese maize croplands under all conditions.

As a beneficial fertilization practice to maintain high crop yield and soil fertility, partial substitution of chemical fertilizer (CF) by organic fertilizer (OF) may exert a notable disturbance to soil systems. However, how nitrite oxidation responds to different proportions of CF to OF is still unclear. We sampled soils from a 4-year field experiment subject to a gradient of increasing proportions of OF to CF application. Activity, size, and structure of Nitrospira-like and Nitrobacter-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) community were measured. The results revealed that with increasing proportion of OF to CF application, potential nitrite oxidation activity (PNO) showed a marked decreasing trend. PNO was significantly correlated with the abundance of Nitrobacter-like but not Nitrospira-like NOB. The abundance of Nitrobacter-like was significantly influenced by soil organic matter, organic nitrogen (N), and available N. In addition, PNO was also affected by the structure of Nitrobacter-like NOB. The relative abundance of Nitrobacter hamburgensis, alkalicus, winogradskyi, and vulgaris responded differently to the proportions of OF to CF application. Organic N, organic matter, and available N were the main factor shaping their community structure. Overall, Nitrobacter-like NOB is more sensitive and plays a more important role than Nitrospira-like NOB in responding to different proportions of OF to CF application.","2021-06","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:54","2021-03-04","29332-29343","","23","28","","Environ.

However, its effectiveness needs to be clarified under specific climate, crop management and soil characteristics. A field experiment was carried out in a Mediterranean drip irrigated maize system to assess the pattern of soil CO2 and N2O fluxes in response to the replacement of a typical bare fallow-maize cycle under urea fertilization (130 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) (CONV) with: (i) bare fallow-maize cycles under two doses of compost (COM1 and COM2, 130 and 260 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively) and (ii) a vetch-maize cycle, with vetch incorporation as green manure (130 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) (GMAN). Along the maize period (MP), reduced daily N2O emissions were detected in organic treated soils compared to CONV, mainly in the first stages of the cultivation, thanks to the slow release of available nitrogen from the organic substrates. Cumulative N2O fluxes (kg N2O-N ha(-1)) in MP scored to 0.24, 0.14, 0.12 and 0.085 for CONV, COM1, COM2 and GMAN, respectively, with significantly lower emissions in GMAN respect to CONV. CO2 fluxes partially reflected the ranking observed for maize yields, with cumulated values (Mg CO2-C ha(-1)) of 2.2, 1.5, 2.1, 2.1 for CONV, COM1, COM2 and GMAN, respectively, and significantly lower in COM1 respect to the other treatments. During the fallow period (FP), compared to CONV (0.77 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) and 0.25 kg N2O -N ha(-1)), enhanced GHG fluxes were detected in COM treatments (about 0.90 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) and 0.37 kg N2O N- ha(-1), as averaged values from COM1 and COM2), likely driven by the slow prolonged mineralization of the added organic matter. GMAN showed comparable CO2 (0.82 Mg CO2-C ha(-1)) and N2O emissions (0.30 kg N2O-N ha(-1)), in consequence of restrained post-harvest residual N coupled with the counteracting effect of vetch uptake. Respect to the total yearly GHG emissions in CONV (about 194 kg CO2 eq ha(-1) y(-1)), the overall results showed commensurate slightly higher GWP in COM treatments (+11% as averaged value from COM1 and COM2). The yield -scaled global warming potential (GWP) resulted 60% higher and nearly doubled for COM2 and COM1 respectively, according to the lower COM yields, markedly dampening at halved compost dose. GMAN appeared the best performing organic treatment, with lower GWP (-27%) and competitive yields respect to CONV. All treatments showed N2O emission factors consistently lower compared with the default IPCC 1% value. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, effectively determining the optimal organic substitution ratio in vegetable production remains uncertain and still relatively unexplored. We conducted a five-year vegetable field experiment and established four nitrogen -equivalent fertilization treatments: mineral fertilizer alone, and organic fertilizer substituting a quarter, half, and entirety of the mineral nitrogen. Employing a specialized multi -level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, our study assessed impacts of different organic substitution ratios on soil qualities, microbial diversity, vegetable yield and quality, environmental risks, and economic benefits in sustainable vegetable production of eastern China. Our results showed that the 50% organic substitution was optimal, significantly improving soil qualities and microbial characteristics, particularly in the topsoil layer. Compared to the control, this approach significantly reduced methane by 6.6 - 48.3%, nitrous oxide by 49.5 - 79.1%, and nitric oxide by 36.5 - 50.0%, while enhancing vegetable yield by 16.0 - 28.3% and its five-year average stability as well as quality as evidenced by increased protein, soluble sugar, and vitamin C contents. Economic analysis revealed that while it maximized environmental benefits, complete organic substitution did not consistently yield positive economic returns. In contrast, a 50% substitution ratio was identified as the most economically viable, representing a sustainable compromise that balances environmental health with economic feasibility. Further modeling analysis indicated an optimal comprehensive range between 42.9% and 64.5% for achieving the best balance of multiple objectives in vegetable fields. The study underscores the intricate organic substitution effects on intensive vegetable production, highlighting the necessity for tailored organic substitution strategies that integrate environmental sustainability with agricultural productivity and economic practicality.","2024-07-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:47","2024-05-16","","","","368","","Agric.

Here, a two-year (2020-2021) field experiment with rice crops in eastern China compared no fertilizer (CK), chemical fertilizer (CF), and 50 % substitution of chemical N with food waste-derived organic fertilizer (CO). Aggregates were categorized into three sizes (> 2 mm, 2-0.25 mm, and < 0.25 mm) using a modified dry-sieving method. Our results indicated that organic substitution (1) increased total N, dissolved organic N, microbial biomass N, and acid hydrolyzable identified N like ammonium N, amino sugar N, and amino acid N across all aggregate sizes, (2) boosted N-acquiring enzyme activities including urease, protease, leucine aminopeptidase, and N-acetyl-beta-Dglucosidase regardless of aggregate fractions, and (3) altered the distribution of bacterial and fungal communities in the aggregates. Additionally, positive correlations with bacterial and fungal communities were found for total N, some organic N fractions and enzymes. The structural equation models revealed that aggregates larger than 2 mm were the primary source of bulk soil organic N pools and microbial community, while aggregates sized 2-0.25 mm contributed mainly to bulk soil enzyme activities. Overall, our study demonstrated that food wastederived organic fertilizer substitution could be an effective practice in improving soil N nutrition and microbial activity, and highlighted the importance of macro-aggregates in bulk soil health and function.","2024-10","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:49","2024-08-30","","","","202","","Appl.

However, the linkage between soil N2O emissions and N-related functional genes under different fertilization strategies from wheat in a wheat-rice double cropping system is rarely examined. Here, we carried out a two-year field study to examine the response of soil N2O emissions driven by N cycling functional genes [archaeal and bacterial amoA (AOA + AOB), nirS, nirK and nosZ] to different fertilization strategies in a wheat cropland of subtropical China. Three fertilizer treatments were established consisting of chemical phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer application (PK), chemical N (urea) and PK fertilizer application (NPK), and chemical NPK fertilizer application with chemical N partially replaced with manure (composted pig manure) (NPKM). Over the two wheat seasons, seasonal total N2O emissions averaged 0.66, 3.60 and 3.11 kg N ha(-1) for PK, NPK and NPKM plots, respectively. Relative to the NPK treatment, the NPKM treatment significantly decreased N2O emissions by 14 % without compromising grain yield, with a lowered combined fertilizer-induced emission factor (EF) of 1.02 %. Compared with the PK treatment, N fertilization consistently and significantly increased the abundance of ammonium-oxidation bacteria (AOB), nirS, nirK and nosZ genes. The nosZ gene, which drives N2O reduction during denitrification, showed a greater extent under NPKM with manure N combination. The AOB had a more sensitive response than ammonium-oxidation archaea (AOA) to chemical N fertilization. Seasonal N2O emissions showed significant positive correlations with AOB gene abundance and the ratio of (nirK+nirS)/nosZ, while had a negative correlation with nosZ gene abundance across N fertilized treatments. The N2O-related microbial composition of functional genes was significantly changed by N fertilizer application and also showed contrasting patterns between treatments of chemical N fertilizer with and without manure N substitution. Together, partially replacing chemical N fertilizer with manure reduced N2O emissions from wheat in a wheat-rice double cropping system, mainly through decreasing AOB associated-nitrifying potential, and particularly stimulating N2O reduction.","2021-05-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:55","2021-03-14","","","","311","","Agric.

However, the effects of labile SOC fractions and microorganisms on GHG emissions from flooding to drying after organic fertilizer replacing for chemical fertilizer remain unclear. Here, a long-term experiment was conducted with four treatments: chemical fertilization only (control), organic fertilizer substituting 25 % of chemical N fertilizer (NM1), 50 % of chemical N fertilizer (NM2), and NM2 combined with crop straw (NMS). GHG emissions were monitored, and soil samples were collected to determine labile SOC fractions and microorganisms. Results revealed the GHG emissions in the NM2 significantly increased by 196.88 % from flooding to drying, mainly due to the higher CO2 emissions. The GHG emissions per kg of C input in NMS was the lowest with the value of 9.17. From flooding to drying, organic fertilizer application significantly increased the readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROC) contents and C lability; the NM2 and NMS dramatically increased the SOC and non-readily oxidizable organic carbon (NROC). The bacterial communities showed significant differences among different treatments in the flooding, while the significant difference was only found between the NMS and other treatments in the drying. From flooding to drying, changing soil moisture conditions causes C fractions and microbial communities to jointly affect carbon emissions, and the NMS promoted carbon sequestration and mitigated GHG emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of the labile SOC fractions and microorganisms linked to GHG emissions in paddy fields.

A 2-year (2012-2013) field experiment was conducted at a typical paddy rice field in a rural suburb of Shanghai, China. N losses and GHG emissions from the paddy field with alternative fertilizer management practices were simultaneously measured. Four treatments were tested in the experiment: applications of only chemical synthetic fertilizer urea (CT), only organic manure (OT), a combination of the two types of fertilizers (MT) and a control (CK). Results from the field study indicated that CT produced the highest seasonal N loading rate (18.79 kg N/ha) and N2O emissions (1.81 kg N2O/ha) but with the lowest seasonal CH4 emissions (69.09 kg CH4/ha). With organic manure applied, MT and OT respectively reduced N loading by 21.86% and 30.41%, reduced N2O emissions by 28.34% and 69.41%, but increased CH4 emissions by 137% and 310% in comparison with CT. However, the net impact of CH4 and N2O emissions on global warming was enhanced when organic manure was applied. In addition, CF and MT produced the optimal rice yield during the experimental period, while OT treatment led to a yield reduction by 9.29% compared with CT. In conclusion, the impacts of alternative fertilizer management practices on ecosystem services ought to be assessed specifically due to the great variations across rice yields, N loss and GHG emissions.

There have been few studies of the sustainability of yield and accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the double-rice cropping system following a partial substitution of chemical fertilizer by Chinese milk vetch (Mv). We conducted a 10-year (2008-2017) field experiment in Nan County, South-Central China, to examine the double-rice productivity and SOC accumulation in a paddy soil in response to different fertilization levels and Mv application (22.5 Mg ha(-1)). Fertilizer and Mv were applied both individually and in combination (sole chemical fertilizers, Mv plus 100, 80, 60, 40, and 0% of the recommended dose of chemical fertilizers, labeled as F100, MF100, MF80, MF60, MF40, and MFO, respectively). It was found that the grain yields of double-rice crop in treatments receiving Mv were reduced when the dose of chemical fertilizer was reduced, while the change in SOC stock displayed a double peak curve. The MF100 produced the highest double-rice yield and SOC stock, with the value higher by 13.5 and 26.8% than that in the F100. However, the grain yields increased in the MF80 (by 8.4% compared to the F100), while the SOC stock only increased by 8.4%. Analogous to the change of grain yield, the sustainable yield index (SYI) of double rice were improved significantly in the MF100 and MF80 compared to the F100, while there was a slight increase in the MF60 and MF40. After a certain amount of Mv input (22.5 Mg ha(-1)), the carbon sequestration rate was affected by the nutrient input due to the stimulation of microbial biomass. Compared with the MFO, the MF100 and MF40 resulted in a dramatically higher carbon sequestration rate (with the value higher by 71.6 and 70. whereas the MF80 induced a lower carbon sequestration rate with the value lower by 70.1% compared to the MFO. Based on the above results we suggested that Mv could partially replace chemical fertilizers (e.g., 40-60%) to improve or maintain the productivity and sustainability of the double-rice cropping system in South-Central China.","2019-10","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:59:30","2019-10-22","2381-2392","","10","18","","J.

We tested the hypothesis that increased N2O flux from soils amended with manure reflects a change in bacterial community structure and, specifically, an increase in the number of denitrifiers. To test this hypothesis, a field experiment was conducted in a drip-irrigated cotton field in an arid region of northwestern China. Treatments included plots that were not amended (Control), and plots amended with urea (Urea), animal manure (Manure) and a 50/50 mix of urea and manure (U+M). Manure was broadcast-incorporated into the soil before seeding while urea was split-applied with drip irrigation (fertigation) over the growing season. The addition treatments did not, as assessed by nextgen sequencing of PCR-amplicons generated from rRNA genes in soil, affect the alpha diversity of bacterial communities but did change the beta diversity. Compared to the Control, the addition of manure (U+M and Manure) significantly increased the abundance of genes associated with nitrate reduction (narG) and denitrfication (nirK and nosZ). Manure addition (U+M and Manure) did not affect the nitrifying enzyme activity (NEA) of soil but resulted in 39-59 times greater denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA). In contrast, urea application had no impact on the abundances of nitrifier and denitrifier genes, DEA and NEA; likely due to a limitation of C availability. DEA was highly correlated (r = 0.70-0.84, P < 0.01) with the abundance of genes narG, nirK and nosZ. An increase in the abundance of these functional genes was further correlated with soil NO3-, dissolved organic carbon, total C, and total N concentrations, and soil C:N ratio. These results demonstrated a positive relationship between the abundances of denitrifying functional genes (narG, nirK and nosZ) and denitrification potential, suggesting that manure application increased N2O emission by increasing denitrification and the population of bacteria that mediated that process.","2019-10-23","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:59:30","2019-10-23","","","","7","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000491858000005","","","18 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study included eight treatments: no fertilizer (control); mineral N fertilizer (Nmin) at a rate of 200 kg N ha(-1) per season; 50% mineral fertilizer N plus 50% cattle manure N (50% CM), 50% chicken manure N (50% FC) or 50% pig manure N (50% FP); 75% mineral fertilizer N plus 25% cattle manure N (25% CM), 25% chicken manure N (25% FC) or 25% pig manure N (25% FP). The annual N2O and NO emissions were 2.71 and 0.39 kg N ha(-1), respectively, under the Nmin treatment, with an emission factor of 0.50% for N2O and 0.07% for NO. Compared with the Nmin treatment, N2O emissions did not differ when 50% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (50% CM, 50% FC and 50% FP), while annual NO emissions were significantly reduced by 49.0% and 27.8% under 50% FC and 50% FP, respectively. In contrast, annual N2O emissions decreased by 21-38% compared to the Nmin treatment when 25% of the mineral N was replaced with manure N (25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP). Most of the reduction occurred during the maize season. The 25% CM, 25% FC and 25% FP treatments had no effect on NO emissions compared to the Nmin treatment. There was no obvious difference in annual N2O and NO emissions among the organic manures at the same application rate, probably due to their similar C/N ratio. Replacing a portion of the mineral fertilizer N with organic fertilizer N did not significantly affect crop grain yield, except for the 50% FC treatment in the wheat season. Overall, the results suggest that the combined application of 25% organic manure N plus 75% mineral fertilizer N had the most potential to mitigate N2O emissions while not affecting crop yield in the maize and wheat rotation system in this area of China.","2020-12","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:59:18","2021-01-12","","","12","10","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000601770500001","","","18 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, field experiments and DNDC model simulations were used to study the long-term effects of substituting synthetic fertilizers with organic manure on crop yield and N2O emission. The field experiment was conducted at Guanzhong Plain, northern China, under a wheat-maize cropping system. Six treatments were included: no fertilization (CK); synthetic nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizers (NPK); and 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the synthetic N substituted by dairy manure (25%M, 50%M, 75%M, and 100%M), respectively. The DNDC model was calibrated using the field data from the NPK treatment from 2014 to 2017 and was validated for the other treatments. The results showed that the DNDC model can successfully simulate the crop yield (e.g. nRMSE < 5%) and annual N2O emission (nRMSE < 20%). In addition, a 30-year simulation found that organic manure substitution treatments could maintain wheat yield well, and the yield variation between different years was small. However, relative to the NPK treatment, the maize yields for the first 6 and 7 years were lower under 50%M and 75%M, and under 100%M maize yields were reduced for the first 15 years. The long-term simulation showed that N2O emission of fertilized treatment had an increasing trend over time, especially the 75%M treatment where the N2O emission was higher than that of NPK treatment after 25 years of fertilization. The annual mean N2O emission under different treatments was, in decreasing order, NPK > 25%M > 50%M > 75%M > 100%M > CK. The yield-scale N2O emission and emission factor were highest for the NPK treatment. Considering crop yield, yield stability and N2O emission, substitution of 25% synthetic fertilizer by organic manure can simultaneously ensure crop productivity and environmental protection under the tested environment.","2020-08-25","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:34","2020-06-26","","","","732","","Sci.

Substantial concern has recently arisen over the need to promote agroecosystems that are more sustainable in order to improve the deteriorating soil health as well as reversing the yield plateau of crop. So, the current on farm field experiment was executed comprising of 8 treatments with different combination of natural farming inputs (Ghanjeevamrit, Jeevamrit, Beejamrit), organic fertilizer (such as FYM), integrated nutrient management (NPK, FYM, Azotobacter and Azolla) and in-organic(NPK) to examine and compare the consequence of natural farming inputs, organic fertilizer and in-organic dosage of fertilizer on soil nitrogen uptake, soil physicochemical properties, soil biological properties, soil microbial population and crop yields in a rice-wheat cropping system over two crop seasons 2021-23 [rice (Pusa-1509) and wheat (HD-3086)]. The study results demonstrated that there was significant (p < 0.05) increase in the soil's nitrogen availability and nitrogen uptake with the use of natural farming inputs as compared to control treatment, whereas, natural farming treatments (T-NF1, T-NF2, T-NF3, T-MNF) were inferior than integrated nutrient management (T-INM) and recommended doses of fertilizer (T-RDF) treatment in case of nitrogen uptake by both rice and wheat crop. The soil enzymatic activity (Dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, and urease), soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and soil microbial population (Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in treatment receiving natural farming inputs compare to in-organic fertilizer and organic fertilizer. A positive and significant correlation was observed between potential mineralization nitrogen and soil enzymatic activity (Dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, and urease), soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and soil microbial population (Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes). The crop yield at the end of experiment recorded to be highest in treatment T-INM (75% RDF (In-organic) + 25% RDF (FYM) + BGA) i.e., (Rice- 4.76 t/ha and Wheat- 5.82 t/ha) compared to TRDF and TNF. A crop yield reduction of 14.2% was observed in treatment receiving natural farming inputs compare to T-INM. A significant increase in crop yield was observed in T-MNF (Jeevamrit (25%) + Ghanjeevamrit (25%) + 50% RDF through FYM + Beejamrit) compare to Tc (Control) and TFYM (Farmyard manure). Therefore, our study suggests that adoption of natural farming inputs over time can facilitate the enhancement of soil biological health of Inceptisol of Trans Gangetic Plain of India.","2024-02-14","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:57","2024-03-27","","","","8","","Front.

The results showed that, compared to F 100 , the O 15 F 85 treatment increased the yield and net ecosystem productivity carbon sequestration of silage maize under mild, moderate, and severe salinization levels, as well as the contents of soil organic carbon, microbial carbon, and humin carbon, while reducing plant carbon emissions. The O 15 F 85 treatment did not significantly increase soil carbon emissions (CEC), but O 30 F 70 , O 45 F 55 and O 100 treatments significantly increased CEC. The soil carbon balance analysis showed that the farmland ecosystem was a ""sink"" for atmospheric CO 2 under each treatment. The O 15 F 85 treatment produced an ""excitation effect"" to enhance the carbon sink effect of silage maize farmland under mild, moderate and severe salinization levels while maintaining stable production and emissions. Although the O 100 treatment increased the carbon sink of farmland under different salinization levels, the yield was significantly reduced and did not represent practical production levels. Correlation analysis showed that soil organic carbon components and ecosystem carbon balance were closely related to soil total salt, pH and bulk density, while soil dissolved organic carbon, humus carbon components and carbon emissions were closely related to soil moisture and temperature. Therefore, the purpose of improving the carbon sink of saline -alkali land can be achieved through soil salt inhibition, soil structure remodeling and water supplement and warming regulation, which provides technical and theoretical support for reducing carbon emissions, achieving carbon neutrality and alleviating global warming.","2024-04","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:53","2024-06-13","159-168","","2","17","","Int.

The application of beneficial microorganisms and organic fertilizer may be an effective measure for sustainable agriculture production. Thus, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of mineral and organic fertilizers (vermicompost/farm yard manure) supplemented with microbial inoculants on growth and soil health parameters of apple (Malus domestica cv. Oregon Spur) under medium density (4 m x 4 m) plantation. Nine integrated treatments of different combination of organic, inorganic and microbial inoculants were studied with four replications. Results revealed that plants received 75% of recommended (RD) NPK + Azospirillium had maximum increase in trunk cross section area (TCSA) and canopy volume (14.3 and 19.3%, respectively), average fruit yield (17.1 t ha(-1)) and production efficiency (0.92 g cm(-2) TCSA) of apple during experiment period (2012-2015). Continuous 3 years of organic fertilization and microbial inoculants enhanced nutrient status of soil. Microbial biomass carbon, N and dehydrogenase activity of soil increased by 37%, 48% and 76%, respectively, in 50% of RD NPK + 25% N through FYM + 25% N through VC over control. Deviation from optimum percentage (DOP) index revealed 50% substitution of inorganic to organic fertilization (FYM and VC) is appropriate to correct deficiency of primary and secondary nutrients in leaves. Canonical correlation analysis revealed yield of apple was negatively correlated with DOP indices. In conclusion, 50% of inorganic fertilizers substituted through VC and FYM, and 25% inorganic fertilizers substituted through inoculation of Azospirillium, resulted higher fruit yield of apple in north west Himalayan region.","2022-02-04","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:35","2021-12-29","346-363","","3","53","","Commun.

Six N fertilizer treatments were evaluated: unfertilized control (CK), mineral N fertilizer (NPK), pig manure (OM), mineral N fertilizer plus pig manure (OM-NPK), crop residue (RSD) and mineral N fertilizer plus crop residue (RSD-NPK). The results showed that the soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in OM (average 13.79 g kg-1) and RSD-NPK (average 13.15 g kg-1) were significantly higher than the other treatments (varied from 5.91 to 11.23 g kg -1) after 18 years. Higher maize yields were observed in NPK, OM, OM-NPK, and RSD-NPK, and especially in RSD-NPK and OM-NPK after 18 years, compared with the data measured in the 11th years. Soil gross N mineralization rates (M) were significantly higher in all N fertilizer treatments (varied from 13.00 to 31.17 mg N kg -1 soil d-1) compared to CK (average 5.53 mg N kg -1 soil d-1). After 18 years of repeated N fertilizer applications, M were significantly higher than those in the 11th years for the same N fertilizer treatment, indicating that long-term repeated N fertilizer application, whether mineral N or organic fertilizer, continuously enhances M. M was positively correlated with SOC (p < 0.05) and total N (TN) (p < 0.05), suggesting that soil organic substrates are key factors regulating M. Maize yield was positively correlated with M (p < 0.05), suggesting that available N produced through soil N mineralization played the important role in yield formation. All N fertilizer treatments continuously stimulated gross autotro-phic nitrification rates (ONH4). ONH4 increased with increasing M (p < 0.01) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) abundance (p < 0.05). However, compared to the 11th year, rates of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and immobilization of NH4+ (except RSD) and NO3- (except OM-NPK) decreased significantly in the N fertilizer treatments in the 18th year, indicating that N retention capacity is reduced over time and the risk of N losses increased. Considering the best balance among food security, soil C sequestration, and reduction of N leaching, mineral N in combination with straw return (RSD-NPK) can be recommended for regions with similar soils and climates.","2023-09","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:43","2023-06-29","","","","189","","Appl.

However, it remains unclear how biogas slurry application affects soil organic carbon (SOC) status and soil microbial community under typical agricultural systems. Here, under a wheat-rice field experiment, we examined the responses of SOC and soil bacterial and fungal communities to biogas slurry application, both with (BSS) and without (BS) straw return, relative to chemical nitrogen fertilizer with (CFS) and without (CF) straw return. The BS treatment significantly increased total organic carbon (TOC) at all soil depths (0-60 cm), compared to CF. Greater TOC occurred at 20-40 cm depth under BSS relative to all other treatments. However, straw return had no impact on soil TOC content under the a and CFS treatments. Labile organic carbon (LOC) in the topsoil and recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC) at 20-60 cm depth was significantly greater under BS relative to CF. The bacterial class Gammaproteobacteria and family Hyphondaobiaceae were found to be specifically abundant under biogas slurry application after one year of wheat-rice double cropping. Network analyses showed that the soil bacterial community under biogas slurry application was more complex than under chemical fertilizer application, while the opposite was true for the fungal community. Correlations between network modules and the SOC fractions indicated that biogas slurry application stimulated soil bacteria and fungi to participate in SOC cycling. The module functionality supports our speculation that soil microorganisms degraded the biogas slurry derived-ROC in the topsoil. Overall, we conclude that substitution of chemical fertilizer with biogas slurry can be beneficial for increasing SOC stocks and, in systems with straw return, enhancing straw decomposition.

A 2-year field experiment (2015-2016) was carried out to assess the effects of substituting equal amounts of mineral fertilizer with organic manure on the yield, dry matter (DM), and nitrogen (N) uptake of spring maize (Zea mays L.) and on the mineral N (Nmin) distribution in the soil profile. The treatments included chemical fertilizer; different amounts of maize straw, cow manure, and chicken manure; and an unfertilized control (CK). Compared with the chemical fertilizer treatments, equal amounts of substitutions with cow manure or chicken manure increased production, and a 25% nutrient substitution resulted in the best yield increase. Straw return had no effect on maize production, and 100% straw return resulted in reduced production. The N accumulation and DM content both exhibited a slow-fast-slow growth trend throughout the various growth stages, and the average N uptake and DM accumulation in response to the treatments followed the order of chicken manure > cow manure > chemical fertilizer > straw return > CK. The Nmin content in the profile not only increased as the Nmin application rate increased but also showed greater increases at certain depths than at the surface, indicating that excessive N led to leaching. These results suggest that an appropriate proportion of organic substitution not only provides enough nutrients but also improves the soil environment and leads to increased yields. This technique represents a practical method of continuously increasing production and reducing the risk of N leaching.","2019-07-09","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:48","2019-09-09","","","7","14","","PLOS One","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000482328300027","","","196 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Substitution of inorganic P fertilizer with organic fertilizer is considered a potential strategy to reduce leaching, but the effect of organic material addition on soil P transformation and leaching loss remains unclear. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy technique can determine P speciation at the molecular level. Here, we integrated XANES and chemical methods to explore P speciation and transformation in a 10-year field experiment with four treatments: 100% chemical fertilizer (4CN), 50% chemical N and 50% manure N (2CN+2MN), 50% chemical N and 50% straw N (2CN+2SN), and 50% chemical N and 25% manure N plus 25% straw N (2CN+2MSN). Compared with the 4CN treatment, the organic substitution treatments increased the content of labile P by 13.7-54.2% in the 0-40 cm soil layers, with newberyite and brushite being the main constituents of the labile P. Organic substitution treatments decreased the stable P content; hydroxyapatite was the main species and showed an increasing trend with increasing soil depth. Straw addition (2CN+2SN and 2CN+2MSN) resulted in a higher moderately labile P content and a lower labile P content in the subsoil (60-100 cm). Moreover, straw addition significantly reduced the concentrations and amounts of total P, dissolved inorganic P (DIP), and particulate P in leachate. DIP was the main form transferred by leaching and co-migrated with dissolved organic carbon. Partial least squares path modeling revealed that straw addition decreased P leaching by decreasing labile P and increasing moderately labile P in the subsoil. Overall, straw addition is beneficial for developing sustainable P management strategies due to increasing labile P in the upper soil layer for the utilization of plants, and decreasing P migration and leaching.","2022","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:29","2022-09-28","2734-2749","","9","21","","J.

Methods: A field experiment under continuous corn with annual manure application was conducted over 32 years in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Corn yield data were categorized into low, intermediate, and high N response groups. Results: On an equivalent amount of manure organic N basis, NFRVs were, on average, 0.38 (+/- 0.02) for stockpiled manure (SM) and 0.27 (+/- 0.02) for incompletely composted or rotted manure (RM), with a wide range of 0.12 (+/- 0.02), 0.28 (+/- 0.02), and 0.37 (+/- 0.04) for RM, and 0.16 (+/- 0.04), 0.39 (+/- 0.03), and 0.48 (+/- 0.04) for SM under the low, intermediate, and high N response conditions, respectively. Supplementing 100 kg synthetic fertilizer N ha-1 in low RM (50 Mg ha-1 fresh weight; f.w.), and 50 kg fertilizer N ha-1 in high RM (100 Mg ha-1 f.w.) application rates decreased NFRVs under low and intermediate N response conditions, whereas the addition of similar synthetic N in the corresponding SM rates reduced NFRVs only under low N response conditions. Conclusions: Based on the 32-year long-term study, we documented that the maximum economic synthetic N fertilizer rates for continuous corn cropping varied from 117 to 179 kg N ha-1 under the low N response, from 127 to 283 kg N ha-1 under the intermediate N response, and from 227 to 289 kg N ha-1 under the high N response conditions. The NFRVs of solid cattle manures varied according to corn yield-N response levels. Implications or significance: Our findings showed that the response of corn yields to manure NFRV depends on the level of yield-N response and climatic conditions. It also indicated the importance of soil organic amendments for improving the climate resilience of corn production, while simultaneously meeting the demand for more sustainable nutrient management of soil resources.","2024-07-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:52","2024-07-14","","","","315","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001263848400001","","","5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 14-year field experiment with no nitrogen fertilizer (CK), urea with 200 kg N ha-1 (U200), urea with 100 kg N ha-1 (U100), manure with 200 kg N ha-1 (M200), manure with 100 kg N ha-1 (M100), and urea with 100 kg N ha-1 plus manure with 100 kg N ha-1 (U100M100) was conducted to assess the effects on soil quality, microbial diversity and yield sustainability. Long-term fertilization increased the alpha-diversity of bacteria and significantly altered the beta-diversity of both bacteria and fungi. Prolonged fertilization significantly augmented soil nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Concomitantly, the activities of urease, invertase, and alkaline phosphatase were substantially elevated. Compared with U200, M200 and U100M100 raised the soil quality index (SQI) by 27-35 % and 11-24 %, respectively. Long-term manure application increased yield by 42-51 % compared with CK. Furthermore, manure application promoted yield stability (CV) and sustainable yield index (SYI) from 2017 to 2023. Notably, U100M100 improved yield, SYI, and SQI more effectively. SQI significantly correlated with yield, SYI, and CV, suggesting its importance for sustainable production. A partial least squares path model showed that the bacterial community influenced SQI by modulating soil nutrients, and the fungal community impacted SQI by affecting soil enzyme activities. Ultimately, these microbial-mediated effects on SQI influenced crop yield. Overall, substitution of partial mineral fertilizers with manure is a promising strategy for sustainable agricultural production in terms of improving soil health and yield sustainability.","2025-05","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:58","2025-04-12","","","","38","","Environ.

Yet, there are still unknown about the substitution impacts of green manure on nitrogen (N) fertilizer in wheat-green manure multiple cropping system. Herein, a five-year field experiment was performed to determine the impact of three levels of N fertilizer inputs [i.e., N fertilizer reduced by 0 % (100N), 10 % (90 N), and 20 % (80 N)] with aboveground biomass of green manure removal (0GM) and return (100GM) on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and its primary determinants. The results demonstrated that no significant interaction on SOC storage was detected between green manure and N fertilizer management. 80 N enhanced SOC storage in bulk soil by 7.4 and 13.2 % in 0 - 20 cm soil depth relative to 100 N and 90 N ( p < 0.05). Regardless of N fertilizer levels, compared with 100GM, 0GM increased SOC storage in bulk soil by 14.2 - 34.6 % in 0 - 40 cm soil depth ( p < 0.05). This was explained by an increase in soil macro -aggregates ( >2 and 0.25 - 2 mm) proportion contributing to SOC physical protection. Meanwhile, the improvement of SOC storage under 0GM was due to the decrease of soil C- and N -acquisition enzyme activities, and microbial resource limitation. Alternatively, the variation partitioning analyses (VPA) results further suggested that C- and N -acquisition enzyme activities, as well as microbial resource limitation were the most important factors for SOC storage. The findings highlighted those biological factors played a dominant role in SOC accumulation compared to physical factors. The aboveground biomass of green manure removal with N fertilizer reduced by 20 % is a viable option to enhance SOC storage in a wheat -green manure multiple cropping system.","2024-05-20","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:58","2024-05-18","","","","926","","Sci.

However, the mechanisms through which the key functional guilds regulate GHG fluxes from cropland remain unclear, especially those involving organisms at higher trophic levels of the soil micro-food webs. Therefore, the responses of key functional guilds to fertilization strategies and their contributions to the fluxes of dominant GHG were estimated to improve our mechanistic understanding. Typical fertilization regimes across the country were included in a long-term field experiment: regular synthetic fertilizers (NPK), partial synthetic nitrogen replacement with pig slurry (OMNPK) and crop straw (RSDNPK) plus a nil fertilizer control (Ctrl). The soil was a net sink of CH4, while fertilization treatments increased the fluxes of N2O and CO2. The cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions followed the order of RSDNPK > OMNPK approximate to NPK > Ctrl. Among the three GHGs, CO2 was the dominant one due to its high quantity and showed strong correlations with five soil labile and stable organic carbon and nitrogen fractions. The key functional guilds that strongly correlated with CO2 fluxes at the aggregate scale were composed of not only soil microbes, but also protists (14-19 %) and nematodes (3-4 %). Fertilization with organic amendments (OMNPK and RSDNPK) significantly changed the composition of the key functional guilds, which, along with key soil parameters, explained 26-35 % of the variation in CO2 fluxes. Protists were ranked as the 1st or 2nd most important biological group in determining the composition of the key functional guilds in all aggregate classes. Conclusively, soil biological groups at higher trophic levels, particularly protists, can serve as the important driver of GHG emissions. Manipulating their activities through targeted fertilization offers an alternative to mitigate the climate impacts of crop production.","2025-04-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:32","2025-01-24","","","","381","","Agric.

This study analyzes the technical potential of nitrogen recovery from livestock manure and crop residues, bringing attention to the often-overlooked resource of digestate derived from anaerobic digestion. Our analysis highlights the significant capacity of the anaerobic digestion process, yielding approximately 234 +/- 5 million metric tons (Mt) of nitrogen annually, sourced 93% from livestock manure and 7% from crop residues. Additionally, we estimated that substituting synthetic nitrogen with nitrogen from anaerobic digestion has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% (185 Mt CO2-eq yr-1). Lastly, 2.5 billion people could be sustained by crops grown using nitrogen from anaerobic digestion of manure and crop residues rather than synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Although agricultural residues have double the technical potential of current synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production, 30% of croplands encounter difficulties in satisfying their nitrogen needs solely through crop residues and anaerobic digestion manure. This deficiency primarily results from inefficient reuse attributed to geographical mismatches between crop and livestock systems. This underscores the urgent need to reconnect livestock and cropping systems and facilitate the transport and reuse of manure in crop production. In conclusion, the mobilization of these large amounts of nitrogen from livestock manure and crop residues will require to overcome the nitrogen from anaerobic digestion green premium with incentives and subsidies.","2024-05-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:06","2024-05-18","","","5","19","","Environ.

Short-term substitution of organic fertilizers for chemical fer-tilizers may mitigate N2O emissions from vegetable fields. However, the long-term impacts, particularly on soil background N2O emissions (excluding effects caused by newly applied fertilizers) in vegetable fields, remain poorly elucidated. Thus, we conducted an 11-year experiment to investigate the long-term fertilization effects on soil background N2O emissions and the abundance of N-cycling genes in a greenhouse vegetable field. The soil capacity for potential denitrification activity (PDA) was further measured to evaluate denitrification potential. The field experiment comprised of four treatments: no fertilization (control, CK), only chemical N fertilizers (CF), 50 % of chemical N fertilizers substituted by organic fertilizers (OL), and 87.5 % of chemical fertilizers substituted by organic fertilizers (OH). The long-term application of chemical fertilizers alone (CF) and organic fertilizer substitutions (OL and OH) increased soil background N2O emissions 30-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with average N2O fluxes of 1.2 +/- 3.8, 33.8 +/- 5.1, 9.4 +/- 2.3 and 10.2 +/- 2.7 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in the CK, CF, OL and OH treatment, respectively. The CF treatment significantly decreased the abundance of AOA amoA, nirS and nosZ genes, while both the OL and OH treatments increased the abundance of AOB amoA, and the OH treatment also increased nosZ gene abundance. Soil pH was a key determinant of the contrasting responses of N-cycling genes to different fertilizer types. Compared with low fertilizer substitutions (OL), high organic fertilizer sub-stitutions (OH) did not result in more soil background N2O emissions, despite higher potential denitrification activities and soil total N contents. This was due to increased abundance of nosZ gene and likely enhanced N2O consumption activities. Soil NO3--N concentrations, soil pH, and the abundance of nosZ gene were three main factors in controlling the responses of soil background N2O emissions to long-term fertilization. Overall, this study suggests that in the long-term perspective organic fertilizer substitution is a beneficial practice to mitigate N2O emissions from intensive greenhouse vegetable cropping systems.","2023-08","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:50","2023-04-07","","","","188","","Appl.

Because of the complex nature, estimators of soil quality often rely upon a limited set of soil attributes, along with statistical data reduction techniques, for developing quality indices, whilst overlooking biological aspects and regional climatic variability. This study screened the most suitable soil quality indexing approaches for a rice-oilseed-based cropping system in the lower Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP). For this, surface soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected from an ongoing long-term fertilizer experiment with a rice-mustard-sesame cropping system in the IGP. The following treatments were assessed for their effect on soil quality: T-1-control, T-2-NPK (recommended NPK doses), T-3-NPKG (NPK + in situ green manuring), T-4-NPKGB (NPK + in situ green manuring + biofertilizer) and T-5-NPKF (NPK + farm yard manure FYM). We found that total organic carbon (TOC), beta-glucosidase, CaCl2 extractable S, alkaline KMnO4 oxidizable N, activity of urease, amidase enzyme and mean weight diameter (MWD) were sensitive key indicators of soil quality. The NPKF treatment maintained the highest soil quality status (0.80-0.91), both under productivity and environmental protection goals, owing to the availability of decomposable carbon. Regression analysis showed a better agreement of equivalent rice yield with expert opinion (EO; R-2 = 0.89) than principal component analysis (PCA; R-2 = 0.76). Finally, we found that the expert opinion approach with the nonlinear scoring function was the best tool for soil quality assessment of the region.","2023-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:16","2022-11-05","503-520","","1","39","","Soil Use Manage.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000873903700001","","","12 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the combined effect of nitrogen fertilizer substitution and reducing irrigation on NH3 volatilization and the role of microorganisms in this process remains unclear. In a soil column experiment, NH3 volatilization and microbial composition were measured under both multiple N sources and different irrigation levels by the vented-chamber method and metagenomic sequencing. The results revealed that multiple N sources application reduced cumulative NH3 volatilization by 16.5-75.4% compared to single chemical fertilizer application, and the decreasing trend of NH3 volatilization under reduced irrigation conditions was greater. Microorganisms had a more important effect on NH3 volatilization of reduced irrigation than conventional irrigation. The abundance of nirA, arcC, E3.5.1.49, and E3.5.5.1 (ammonia-producing) genes varied significantly at the two irrigation levels.

While bacteria and fungi play a key role in SOC accumulation, the effects of soil micro-food webs that include organisms from higher trophic levels remain uncertain. We sought to narrow this knowledge gap by clarifying the associations between SOC accumulation and soil micro-food webs at the aggregate scale under long-term (18 years) fertilization treatments, which included a no-fertilizer control (Ctrl), synthetic fertilizers (NPK), and partial synthetic nitrogen replacement with pig slurry (OMNPK) or crop straw (RSDNPK). The concentration of SOC was significantly increased by fertilization following the order RSDNPK (13.1 g kg(-1)) > OMNPK (11.4 g kg(-1)) > NPK (9.1 g kg(-1)) > Ctrl (6.4 g kg(-1)). Nematodes and protists accounted for approximately 20% of all nodes in the multitrophic networks. Fertilization increased network complexity at the aggregate scale by 1-4 times across different sampling dates (P < 0.05). In all aggregate classes, the functionally important (FI) nematodes, protists, and bacterial taxa involved in soil carbon cycle had higher relative abundances under the fertilization treatments than under the Ctrl (P < 0.05). Structural equation modeling further indicated that besides soil microbes, network complexity, FI nematodes and protists were important to SOC accumulation. Compared with NPK, the key moments during which these soil biological attributes strongly regulated SOC under OMNPK and RSDNPK were delayed to late growth stages of maize. In conclusion, the increased network complexity and relative abundance of functionally important organisms from higher trophic levels of the soil micro-food webs at certain periods are vital contributors to effective SOC accumulation under fertilization regimes that include organic amendments.","2024-02-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:46","2023-12-17","","","","360","","Agric.

To assess the effect of alfalfa green manure on maize yield, soil nutrients, enzymes, and microorganisms, we conducted a two-year field experiment comprising eight treatments: four CF levels (100%, 80%, 60%, and 0% of recommended CF) applied alone or combined with alfalfa green manure (CF100, AL_CF100, CF80, AL_CF80, CF60, AL_CF60, CF0, AL_CF0). The results showed that maize grain yield decreased with the sole reduction of chemical N fertilizer. Compared to the CF100 treatment, the AL_CF100 and AL_CF80 treatments significantly increased grain yield by an average of 21.8% and 16.9%, respectively. Additionally, the AL_CF60 treatment maintained maize grain yield in 2020 and significantly increased it in 2021. The AL_CF100 treatment significantly enhanced soil available N (AN) content, while soil Olsen-P (SOP) content and soil quality index (SQI) were significantly improved in the AL_CF100, AL_CF80, and AL_CF60 treatments. Alfalfa green manure application had no significant effect on soil bacterial and fungal communities. However, the CF rates positively influenced the relative abundances of bacterial phyla (Bacteroidota, Myxococcota, and Patescibacteria) and genera (Intrasporangium, Streptomyces, and Quadrisphaera), as well as fungal genera (Exophiala and Setophoma). alpha-Diversity analysis revealed that partial substitution of CF with alfalfa green manure did not significantly affect soil bacterial diversity (Ace, Shannon, and Sobs indices) or richness (Chao value). In contrast, chemical N fertilizer rates significantly altered the beta-diversity of both bacteria and fungi. The soil AN, AK, sucrase activity, and the relative abundances of Bacteroidota, Streptomyces, and Instrasporangium showed significant positive relationship with maize grain yield.

There is less rainfall in these areas, and the groundwater has a high sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and pH. However, by moderating soil fertility characteristics, these sites have a lot of potential for increasing the mustard yield. For this, a field experiment was conducted with four levels of sodicity water irrigation (6, 10, 20, and 30 SAR) and six levels of nitrogen (composed of different combinations with urea, farm yard manure-FYM, and vermicompost-VC). After harvesting of the crop, soil and plant samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties. Experimental results showed an increasing level of SAR mediating the soil parameters like soil organic carbon, available water content, and also mustard crop yield. Although replacement of N application doses with FYM and VC showed improvement in SOC and available water, it reduced soil pH, EC, SAR, and bulk density. Increasing sodicity levels from 6 to 20 SAR reduced the mustard seed yield by 16.05 q ha(-1) to 9.76 q ha(-1), whereas 50% RDN through urea and 75% RDN through VC increased the seed yield by 8.28 to 16.27 q ha(-1). Such studies have opened the door for sustainable mustard production in high sodicity areas, i.e. western part of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, and Punjab states by application of nitrogen through organics. It will improve the mustard growers' economic situation and contribute greatly to the country's economic growth in sodic soil areas.","2022-01-02","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:24","2021-10-09","77-88","","1","53","","Commun.

Methods This study employed a comprehensive two-year field experiment to elucidate the dynamics of rhizosphere microbiome-plant interactions under stover and organic substitution strategies on the Loess Plateau, facilitated by high-throughput sequencing and carbon and nitrogen composition analyses. Results The findings revealed a significant enrichment in the content of rhizosphere carbon and nitrogen components, with the plant height, yield, and harvest index of spring maize increasing by 2.56%, 5.19%, and 2.67%, respectively, compared to the chemical fertilizer. The dataset, encompassing the rhizosphere microbiome and soil moisture and carbon components, exhibited a strengthened correlation following stover recycling. Concurrently, the rhizosphere bacterial community matrix of spring maize correlated with dissolved organic nitrogen and soil organic carbon in the nutrient matrix by altering carbon and nitrogen cycle pathways upon stover incorporation. Phylogenetic null model calculations demonstrated that prolonged stover recycling mitigated the processes of dispersal limitation and homogeneous selection in rhizosphere fungal communities, with their formation and maintenance predominantly reliant on stochastic events rather than species' adaptive traits. The rhizosphere microbial co-occurrence network analysis indicated that stover recycling exerted a more pronounced effect on enhancing positive connections within the fungal network compared to the bacterial network. Conclusions Collectively, our findings offer profound insights into the rhizosphere soil microbial interactions with spring maize in rain-fed agricultural areas.","2025-04-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:37","2025-04-06","","","","","","Plant Soil","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001457019800001","","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have paid close attention to pineapples in the tropics. Here, a 2-year field experiment was conducted to elucidate the differences in pineapple rhizosphere soil microorganisms, bulk soil chemical characteristics, and pineapple fruit yield under different fertilization treatments (CK: no fertilizer application; FP: conventional chemical fertilizer application; OPT: reduced chemical fertilizer application; OPTO: based on OPT, with organic fertilizer replacing 20 % of nitrogen (N); OPTS: based on OPTO, with slow-release fertilizer replacing 15 % of N), and the links between soil microorganisms and soil chemical properties and pineapple fruit yield were analyzed. Compared with FP, OPT, OPTO and OPTS treatments significantly increased bulk soil pH and organic matter (OM) content while reducing the amount of available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+); in addition, they also highly increased the bacterial diversity index and pineapple yield (P < 0.05). It was found that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria were the four major bacterial phyla (relative abundances >10 %) in all treatments, while Ascomycota was the main phylum of fungi. Specifically, the OPTS treatment increased the abundance of Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Basidiomycota but decreased the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Ascomycota. Correlation analysis found that bulk soil pH, OM, AP, AK, NO3- and NH4+ levels were all important factors influencing the formation of the rhizosphere soil microbial community. Overall, the OPTS treatment resulted in relatively high soil nutrient content, microbial diversity and the number of beneficial microorganisms, which increased pineapple yield. Therefore, OPTS can be used as a high-yield and sustainable fertilization method for pineapple.","2023-09","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:14","2023-07-17","","","","189","","Appl.

Agriculture makes up a disproportionate share of net US greenhouse gas emissions compared to its contribution to the economy; the issue may be related to the decrease in crop diversity and reliance on synthetic fertilizer. In the US Corn Belt, crop rotational diversity is mostly limited to maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max). We compared soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from a long-term experiment comparing the 2-year maize-soybean rotation to two other more diversified rotations: a 3-year maize-soybean-oat (Avena sativa)/red clover (Trifolium pratense) and a 4-year maize-soybean-oat/alfalfa (Medicago sativa)]-alfalfa rotations. Both 3- and 4-year rotations also received composted cattle (Bos taurus) manure. We tested whether these more diversified rotations that replace a portion of the synthetic fertilizer with organic sources could decrease CO2 and N2O losses. Soil CO2 fluxes in the 3- or 4-year rotations were 36% and 54% greater than in the 2-year rotation, driven by the maize phase, which might be due to the prior years' leguminous crops (red cover or alfalfa), tillage, and manure. The crop phases within a rotation had significant effect on soil CO2 (alfalfa > oat > maize = soybean) and N2O (maize = alfalfa > soybean = oat) fluxes. Soil temperature-crop phase interactions had more control over soil CO2 fluxes than soil moisture. In the Central Corn Belt of the United States, replacing fertilizer-N supported maize-soybean rotation with diversified rotation and replacing inorganic N with an organic N source increased soil CO2 flux but did not affect N2O flux.","2025","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:41","2025-07-17","","","e70171","8","","Agrosyst.

Previous studies have indicated that replacing urea-based N fertilisers by manure may reduce NH3 emissions and enhance crop yield. However, the long-term effects of replacing urea N fertiliser by manure on crop yield and NH3 emissions have not been sufficiently quantified. The objective of the field study presented here was to examine the effects of three treatments (i.e., 100% synthetic fertiliser N application (NPK); 50% synthetic fertiliser N +50% manure N application (50%MNS); and 100% manure N application (100%MNS)) on NH3 emissions and maize grain yields over a 3-year period in a long term (13 years) study site in the North China Plain. Results showed that the NH3 emissions in the NPK treatment ranged from 9.7 to 11.7 kg ha(-1) during the three maize growing seasons. Replacement of urea fertiliser by manure significantly decreased the NH3 emissions by 22-54% in the 50% MNS treatment and by 47-71% in the 100%MNS treatment. Maize grain yields were 14-30% higher in the 50%MNS treatment and 17-45% higher in the 100% MNS treatment, compared to the NPK treatment (8.1-8.8 t ha(-1)). The NH3 emission factor for the NPK treatment ranged from 4.1 to 4.8%. Additional 15 N labelling work established that 83% of NH3 emissions originated from the urea fertiliser in the NPK treatment. Manure treatments had a higher maize N uptake and soil organic matter content, and a lower soil pH than the NPK treatment. This study highlights that replacing synthetic N fertiliser with manure on farmland in the North China Plain has long-term beneficial effects on maize yield and N uptake, NH3 emission mitigation and soil carbon storage.","2023-09","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:17","2022-12-30","23-35","","1","127","","Nutr.

However, many smallholder farmers lack access to sufficient amounts of these inputs to improve the fertility and reduce the aluminium toxicity of Ferralsols. Organic manures are available but often have low nutrient content, which limits their ability to supply nutrients to soils. In a two-factor field experiment over four seasons on an Anthropic Ferralsol in Southern Province, Rwanda, we assessed (i) the effect of cattle manure on soil properties at a reduced rate affordable to smallholder farmers compared with that of NPK fertiliser applied, with and without lime also at a reduced rate, and (ii) the effect of supplementing grass in a basal cattle diet with legume leaves on manure quality and its effect on soil properties. Manure from cattle fed only the grassChloris gayana(grass-only manure) and from cattle fedC. gayanasupplemented withAcacia angustissimaleaves (grass+legume manure) was applied at 5 t dry matter ha(-1)(25% of the recommended rate) at the beginning of each growing season. NPK was applied as split doses supplying a total rate of 70 kg N ha(-1). Lime was applied annually at a rate of 2.0 t CaO ha(-1), which was 25% of the rate required to neutralise total acidity at the site. All amendments were applied only to the soil surrounding the maize plants (planting stations), which is estimated at 25% of the plot area. Maize stover was left on plots after harvest and planting stations were retained over all growing seasons. All treatments altered soil properties at the planting stations. Lime generally increased pH but there was no significant difference between lime plus manure treatments and non-limed manure treatments. Soil organic carbon concentration and cation exchange capacity were higher in manure and NPK treatments than in non-fertilised treatments. The manure treatment increased soil water-holding capacity compared with the NPK and non-fertilised treatments. There was no significant difference in total N, Ca2+, Mg(2+)and K(+)between the NPK and manure treatments. Micro-dosing animal manure can thus replace mineral fertiliser plus lime for soil fertility replenishment in smallholder farming. Grass+legume manure contained higher concentrations of total N, Ca, Mg, K and Na than grass-only manure, but its effect on soil properties did not differ significantly from that of grass-only manure.","2020-08","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:59:17","2020-09-08","483-494","","4","56","","Exp.

However, it is unclear whether reducing nitrogen by reapplying green manure to fields can achieve high crop yields and improve carbon mitigation. Objective: This study aims to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of carbon emissions in maize fields under green manure reapplication combined with a reduction in nitrogen. Methods: A field experiment comprising five treatments (green manure reapplication combined with traditional nitrogen application (N100), green manure reapplication combined with a reduction in nitrogen of 10% (N90), green manure reapplication combined with a reduction in nitrogen of 20% (N80), green manure reapplication combined with a reduction in nitrogen of 30% (N70), and green manure reapplication combined with a reduction in nitrogen of 40% (N60)) was conducted at an arid oasis region in northwestern China from 2020 to 2022. This study investigated the effects of reducing nitrogen application while reapplying green manure to the field on maize grain yield, soil respiration rate, and carbon emission efficiency (CEE) and analyzed the relationship between soil respiration rate and soil temperature (Ts), soil water content (SWC), and crop biomass accumulation (BA). Results: The N80 treatment significantly reduced soil carbon emissions (CE) but did not reduce maize grain yield, and it showed a significant increase in CEE of 7.7% compared with the N100 treatment. In addition, this system can ensure no reduction in net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and carbon sequestration (CS) potential compared with N100 and significantly improves the NPP/CE value. Soil temperature and crop biomass significantly correlated with soil respiration, which explained 68.4-72.9% and 84.4-88.8% of the seasonal variation of soil respiration, respectively. However, there was no correlation between soil moisture and soil respiration. Conclusion: Therefore, reducing nitrogen application by 20% while multiple cropping with green manure application after wheat was a suitable nitrogen fertilizer management measure for improving carbon mitigation in arid areas without sacrificing maize yield. Implications: The results of this study provide valuable insights into long-term agricultural management strategies for achieving high agricultural production and environmental friendliness.","2024-02-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:49","2024-01-25","","","","306","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001145231300001","","","19 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the unreasonable application of chemical fertilizer will inhibit this process of dissolving phosphorus. Until now, although the fact that straw is the optimal C source has been recognized, its impact onphoD-harboring bacteria under decreasing chemical fertilizer is not clear. Materials and methods A field experiment was established with chemical fertilizer only (F) and the gradient inorganic fertilizer reduction with straw: inorganic fertilizer with straw (FS), 70% inorganic fertilizer with straw (0.7FS), 60% inorganic fertilizer with straw (0.6FS), and 50% inorganic fertilizer with straw (0.5FS). Mixed treatments received equal amounts of straw. Integrated high-throughput absolute abundance quantification (iHAAQ) was used to investigate thephoDbacterial community structure. Results and discussion From the correlation between the plant-total P of three vegetables and microbial variables, only the plant-total P of chili was significantly related to ALP and the abundance ofphoDgene. Although the total vegetable yield was significantly increased by the addition of straw, no correlation with ALP andphoDbacterial community was found. In addition, the abundance of thephoDbacterial community and the levels of ALP activity were both higher in a regime featuring 70% inorganic fertilization with straw (0.7FS), but the ability ofphoDbacteria ALP release was strongly activated in a regime featuring 50% inorganic fertilization with straw (0.5FS). Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) indicated that the community ofphoDbacteria clustered four groups and suggested that a number of soil factors played key roles in shaping the entirephoDbacterial community, including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, Ca2+-Ex, and total potassium. The correlation between the absolute abundance of ALP-regulating bacteria and ALP activity suggests thatAmycolatopsismay predominantly account for ALP activity, especially in the 0.5FS regime.

Nevertheless, organic amendments promote the global warming potential (GWP) in rice paddies due to increased methane (CH4) emissions. Increasing evidence shows that lime application can reduce CH4 emissions from acidic paddy soils; however, it is still not clear whether liming can reduce the GWP in rice fields under organic manure substitution. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the impacts of pig manure substitution and lime application on grain yield, CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a subtropical double-cropped rice field in China. The experiment consisted of three treatments: CF (100% chemical nitrogen fertilizer), 1/2N + M (50% of the applied nitrogen substituted by pig manure, M represents manure), and 1/2N + M + L (lime amendment with 50% of the applied nitrogen substituted with pig manure, L represents lime). On average, 1/2N + M reduced rice yield by 5.65% compared to CF, while the lime application had no effect on rice yield. Mean cumulative CH4 emissions were 218.8% higher in 1/2N + M than in CF, whereas 1/2N + M + L reduced CH4 emissions by 36.6% compared to 1/2N + M. Neither pig manure substitution nor lime application affected N2O emissions. Consequently, 1/2N + M increased the GWP and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) by 214.6% and 228.3%, respectively, compared to CF. In contrast, 1/2N + M + L reduced the GWP and GHGI by 36.4% and 36.5% compared to 1/2N + M.

This study was conducted at the Experimental Station of China Agricultural University in Quanyangou, Lishu County, Siping City, Jilin Province. Static greenhouse gas chromatography was used to monitor soil greenhouse gas fluxes under different fertilization measures, and the different fertilization treatments were analyzed for comprehensive differences in greenhouse effects among corn fields. The results showed that the average CO2 fluxes and total emissions in response to the straw return treatment were the highest, reaching 388.96 mg.m(-2).h(-1) and 14718.97 kg.hm(-2), respectively, and nitrogen topdressing fertilizer significantly increased CO2 emissions. With respect to CH4 emissions, single fertilizer-treated plots had the highest average absorbed flux and total absorption-0.042 mg.m(-2).h(-1) and 1.36 kg.hm(-2), respectively, and with respect to N2O fluxes, the highest flux and , amount were 0.153 mg.m(-2).h(-1) and 5.75 kg.hm(-2), respectively. The global warming potential of the straw in situ treatment was significantly higher than that of the other treatments, and the global warming potential of the cattle manure treatment was lower than that of the single chemical fertilizer treatment, but the differences were not significant. Moreover, straw mulch increased CO2 emissions from black soils, and dry soils were shown to be important sinks of atmospheric CH4. Combinations of organic and inorganic fertilizers and individual fertilizers can reduce N2O emissions from soils. Therefore, to achieve higher corn yields and to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensities simultaneously, applications of organic and inorganic fertilizers constitute an ideal soil fertility method in the black soil region of Northeast China.","2019","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:59:33","2019-02-15","1321-1335","","1","17","","Appl.

Crop residues were applied to cattle feed, and the composted cattle manure was returned to cropland with a winter wheat and maize rotation. Four different proportions of fertilizers were designed: 100 % cattle manure, 100 % mineral nitrogen, 75 % cattle manure plus 25 % mineral nitrogen, and 50 % cattle manure plus 50 % mineral nitrogen. Crop yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were carefully calculated according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2006. Our results showed that replacing chemical fertilizer with organic manure significantly decreased the emission of GHGs. Yields of wheat and corn also increased as the soil fertility was improved by the application of cattle manure. Totally replacing chemical fertilizer with organic manure decreased GHG emissions, which reversed the agriculture ecosystem from a carbon source (+2.7 t CO2-eq. hm(-2) year(-1)) to a carbon sink (-8.8 t CO2-eq. hm(-2) year(-1)).

Widespread soil acidification due to fertilization neutralize carbonates getting an irrecoverable net source of CO2 out of SIC. Nevertheless, SIC is generally neglected as a CO2 source and disregarded in the C balance between soil and atmosphere. A 40-year fertilization field experiment provides an excellent option to investigate the influences of mineral and organic fertilizers on carbonate-derived CO2 efflux by partitioning CO2 sources using the delta 13C signature. Although 40 years of mineral fertilizers caused soil acidification and SIC neutralization, SIC-derived CO2 was comparable with that from the control soils. This could be explained by that mineral fertilizer decreased soil-derived CO2 production and the partial pressure of soil CO2, which led to the weak reduction of SIC dissolution in the long term. Thus, the annual contribution of SIC-derived CO2 to total CO2 under long-term mineral fertilization may look as of minor importance. Organic fertilizers (manure, straw) reduced the proportional contribution of SIC-derived COQ by 16-42 % relative to controls, despite elevating total COQ emissions by 5.4-9.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. This divergence stems from Ca2+ inputs during organic matter decomposition, which catalyzed COQ reprecipitation as pedogenic carbonates, decoupling dissolution from atmospheric release. Crucially, manure amendments achieved net soil C sequestration (0.47 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). In contrast, straw-induced SIC losses (2.0 Mg C ha-1 over 40 years) negated 52 % of SOC gains, yielding marginal net sequestration (2.4 +/- 1.7 Mg C ha-1). These results underscore the imperative to evaluate SIC-SOC interactions when assessing the climate efficiency of organic management. SIC-derived COQ efflux fluctuated seasonally, peaking during the flowering phase (19-35 % of total emissions), then declining by 5.0-9.7 %. This temporal decoupling highlights rhizosphere activity as a key regulator of SIC. Ignoring SIC contributions led to a 35 % overestimation of heterotrophic respiration in total COQ efflux, illustrating systemic biases in current C models. Our findings advocate for manure-based management to maximize C sequestration not as SOC but as SIC and to minimize CO2 emissions from SIC, a dual strategy to reconcile agricultural productivity with climate resilience in semi-arid regions.","2025-10-15","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:30","2025-06-06","","","","392","","Agric.

N2O can be produced via multiple processes, and reduced, with the involvement of more diverse microbes with different physiological constraints than previously thought; therefore, there is a lack of consensus on the production processes and microbes involved under different agricultural practices. In this study, multiple approaches were applied, including N2O isotopocule analyses, microbial gene transcript measurements, and selective inhibition assays, to revisit the involvement of NH3 oxidizers and denitrifiers, including the previously-overlooked taxa, in N2O emission from a cropland, and address the biological and environmental factors controlling the N2O production processes. Then, we synthesized the results from those approaches and revealed that the overlooked denitrifying bacteria and fungi were more involved in N2O production than the long-studied ones. We also demonstrated that the N2O production processes and soil microbes involved were different based on fertilization practices (plowing or surface application) and fertilization types (manure or urea). In particular, we identified the following intensified activities: (1) N2O production by overlooked denitrifying fungi after manure fertilization onto soil surface; (2) N2O production by overlooked denitrifying bacteria and N2O reduction by long-studied N2O-reducing bacteria after manure fertilization into the plowed layer; and (3) N2O production by NH3-oxidizing bacteria and overlooked denitrifying bacteria and fungi when urea fertilization was applied into the plowed layer. We finally propose the conceptual scheme of N flow after fertilization based on distinct physiological constraints among the diverse NH3 oxidizers and denitrifiers, which will help us understand the environmental context-dependent N2O emission processes.","2021-10-15","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:53","2021-09-25","","","","287","","Environ.

Four nutrient regimes, a control, chemical fertilizers only (CF), chemical fertilizers with swine manure (SM), and chemical fertilizers with wheat straw (WS), and two soil moisture regimes, continuous waterlogging (CWL) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD), were investigated. With SM and WS total organic carbon and total nitrogen in the paddy soil were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those with CF. A similar effect for organic amendments was observed in the soil light fraction organic C (LFOC), water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), and water-soluble organic C (WSOC). CWL, in particular when swine manure was incorporated into the paddy soil, markedly decreased soil redox potential (Eh) and increased total active reducing substances (ARS). Meanwhile, as compared to CF, SM and WS significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and mineralizable carbon, with differences in AWD being higher than CWL. In addition, SM and WS treatments significantly (P < 0.05) improved rice above-ground biomass and grain yield, with AWD being greater than CWL.

However, the average productivity of the crop has stagnated at around 2,000 kg ha(-1) in India. Recently released nutrient responsive high yielding varieties are reported to respond better to application of fertilizers/manures. Further, substitution of chemical fertilizers with organic manures to maintain sustainable yields and improve soil health is gaining attention in recent years. Therefore, identifying the appropriate rate and source of nutrition is important to enhance the productivity of finger millet while improving the soil health. A field experiment was conducted during two rainy seasons (July-November, 2018 and 2019) to study the response of finger millet varieties to chemical fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM) on growth, yields, N use efficiency, N uptake and on soil properties. Two varieties MR-1 and MR-6 were tested with four nutrient management practices viz., unamended control, 100% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF; 40-20-20 kg NPK ha(-1)), 50% RDF + 50% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) as FYM and 100% RDN as FYM. Among the varieties, MR-6 outperformed MR-1 in terms of growth, yield, N use efficiency and N uptake. The yield enhancement was up to 22.6% in MR-6 compared to MR-1 across the nutrient management practices. Substituting FYM completely or half of the fertilizer dose increased the growth and yield of finger millet compared to application of chemical fertilizers alone. Similarly, the average biomass yield, ears m(-2), grain yield, total N uptake and N use efficiency in response to nutrient management practices followed the order of 100% RDN as FYM > 50% RDF + 50% RDN as FYM > 100% RDF. The soil organic carbon, available N, P, K, and S improved by 25.0, 12.9, 5.7, 6.1, and 22.6%, respectively in the plots under higher rate of FYM application (8 Mg ha(-1)) compared to plots under chemical fertilizers alone. We conclude that substituting chemical fertilizers either completely or by up to 50% with organic manures supplies adequate amounts of nutrients, improves the yield of finger millet, economic returns, and soil properties.","2023-10-12","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:12","2023-11-11","","","","10","","Front.

To broaden our knowledge, high-throughput pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR were used to explore the impacts of inorganic fertilizer and manure on bacterial community composition in a 35-year field experiment of Chinese Mollisols. Soils were collected from four treatments: no fertilizer (CK), inorganic phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer (PK), inorganic P, K, and N fertilizer (NPK), and inorganic P and K fertilizer plus manure (MPK). All fertilization differently changed soil properties. Compared with CK, the PK and NPK treatments acidified soil by significantly decreasing soil pH from 6.48 to 5.53 and 6.16, respectively, while MPK application showed no significant differences of soil pH, indicating alleviation of soil acidification. Moreover, all fertilization significantly increased soil organic matter (OM) and soybean yields, with the highest observed under MPK regime. In addition, the community composition at each taxonomic level varied considerably among the fertilization strategies. Bacterial taxa, associated with plant growth promotion, OM accumulation, disease suppression, and increased soil enzyme activity, were overrepresented in the MPK regime, while they were present at low abundant levels under NPK treatment, i.e. phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, class Alphaproteobacteria, and genera Variovorax, Chthoniobacter, Massilia, Lysobacter, Catelliglobosispora and Steroidobacter.

Chemical fertilizer application rate was reduced to a third of the recommended rate of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Treatments consisted of five levels of CMC (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 Mg.ha(-1)). There was a significant increasing effect on growth and yield parameters by applying CMC compared with 0 Mg.ha(-1). In addition, there was also a significant increasing quadratic effect on yield on increasing CMC rates from 0 to 80 Mg.ha(-1) with an R-2 of 0.46. Maximum marketable yield was 62.7 Mg.ha(-1) at 40 Mg.ha(-1) CMC, which was due to increased stand reduction and unmarketable bulbs as well as decreased bulb weight at higher rates of CMC. The CMC rates had no effect on bulb dry weight and N or P concentration in the bulb and leaf. Furthermore, there was an increasing linear effect on soil pH, and organic matter (OM), available P, and exchangeable cations throughout vegetative growth and at harvest.

However, the synthetical effects of organic fertilizer combined with straw returning on soil quality remain unknown, especially in response to soil nitrification and denitrification microorganisms. We set up an experiment in brunisolic soil from Northeast China, mainly including four treatments: CK (no addition without traditional chemical fertilizer), O (organic fertilizer application), S (straw returning), and OS (organic fertilizer combined with straw returning). The soil nitrification and denitrification microorganisms were further investigated using high-throughput sequencing. Our results show that, compared to CK, the soil water content, field capacity, macroaggregates with a diameter > 0.25 mm, mean weight diameter, total carbon, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen were significantly improved, and penetration resistance was reduced in a 0-20 cm soil layer under O, S, and OS treatments. Moreover, OS treatment effectively increased the available potassium and available phosphorus content and decreased the three-phase R-value. The application of organic fertilizer and straw effectively optimized the soil structure, especially the OS treatment. Compared to CK, O, S, and OS treatments had a higher abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and further enhanced the alpha diversity and lower abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nirK-, nirS-, and nosZ-type denitrifying microbes. AOA and nirK were the key drivers of the ammonia oxidation process and nitrite reduction process, respectively. Meanwhile, the application of organic fertilizer and straw regulated the relative abundance of Nitrososphaeria (AOA), Gammaproteobacteria (nirK and nirS), Alphaproteobacteria (nirK), and Betaproteobacteria (nirS) in the soil. Organic fertilizer and straw returning regulated the soil structure by enhancing the abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria in the nitrifying and denitrifying microorganism communities. Taken together, OS treatment was a suitable straw-returning practice for optimizing the nutrient balance of the farmland ecosystem in Northeast China. However, this study did not determine how to reduce traditional nitrogen fertilizer applications under organic fertilizer application and straw returning; therefore, we aim to carry out related research in future works.","2023-08","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:09","2023-09-07","","","8","13","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001056704900001","","","7 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corn growers who plan to remove corn stover as a feedstock for the emerging cellulosic ethanol industry will benefit from carbon amendments such as manure and compost, to replace carbon removed with the corn stover. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of beef cattle feedlot manure and composted dairy manure on short-term carbon sequestration rates and net global warming potential (GWP) in a corn-soybean rotation with complete corn-stover removal. Field experiments consisting of a corn-soybean rotation with whole-plant corn harvest, were conducted near East Lansing, MI over a three-year period beginning in 2002. Compost and manure amendments raised soil carbon (C) at a level sufficient to overcome the C debt associated with manure production, manure collection and storage, land application, and post-application field emissions. The net GWP in carbon dioxide equivalents for the manure and compost amended cropping systems was -934 and -784 g m(-2) y(-1), respectively, compared to 52 g m(-2) y(-1) for the non-manure amended synthetic fertilizer check.

Here, we carried out a two-year field study to assess the response of soil N2O and NO emissions as an interplay with NUE to different fertilization strategies in a typical winter wheat-summer rice rotation cropland of subtropical China. Three fertilizer treatments were established consisting of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer application (PK), NPK fertilizer application (NPK), and NPK fertilizer application with N partially replaced with manure (NPKM). Annual N2O, NO and N2O + NO emissions averaged 0.96, 0.24 and 1.19 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the PK plots and 6.54, 1.48 and 8.03 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the NPK plots, respectively. Relative to the NPK plots, partially replacing chemical N fertilizer with manure decreased annual N2O and NO emissions and their combined emissions by 13-15%, while it significantly enhanced crop NUE as compared to the NPK plots. Annual mean emission factors (EFs) of N fertilizer for N2O and NO were estimated to be 1.17% and 0.26% for the NPK plots, and 0.99% and 0.22% for the NPKM plots, respectively. Both N2O and NO emissions were positively correlated with N surplus, while yield-scaled N2O + NO emissions and the fertilizer N-induced combined EF for N2O + NO were negatively related to crop NUE.

However, these management practices may induce important changes in the nitrogen oxide emissions from these agroecosystems, with additional impacts on carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out with a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) crop under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of combining maize (Zea mays L.) residues and N fertilizer inputs (organic and/or mineral) on these emissions.Crop yield and N uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), denitrification capacity, N2O, NO and CO2 fluxes were measured during the growing season.The incorporation of maize stover increased N2O emissions during the experimental period by c. 105 %. Conversely, NO emissions were significantly reduced in the plots amended with crop residues. The partial substitution of urea by pig slurry reduced net N2O emissions by 46 and 39 %, with and without the incorporation of crop residues respectively. Net emissions of NO were reduced 38 and 17 % for the same treatments. Molar DOC:NO (3) (-) ratio was found to be a robust predictor of N2O and NO fluxes.The main effect of the interaction between crop residue and N fertilizer application occurred in the medium term (4-6 month after application), enhancing N2O emissions and decreasing NO emissions as consequence of residue incorporation. The substitution of urea by pig slurry can be considered a good management strategy since N2O and NO emissions were reduced by the use of the organic residue.","2013-03","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:59:57","2013-03-06","357-371","","1-2","364","","Plant Soil","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000314722800029","","","78 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We here conducted a two-year field experiment in a typical soil (classified as an Anthrosol) used for vegetable cultivation, with high nitrate residue, in China, to investigate the comprehensive effects of various proportions of manure N and urea N (0-100 % manure N) on yield, N2O emission, and global warming potential (GWP). 25 % and 50 % manure-N substitutions increased the yield, over five vegetable-growing seasons, by 5-31 %, compared with 100 % urea-N. Cumulative N2O emissions and the sum of GWP (mGWP) also increased with the ratio of manure N to urea N.

Our study shows that higher relative manure-N quantities can be beneficial to yield but increase N2O emission, and highlights the importance of carefully balancing manure substitution ratios in high-nitrate vegetable soils.","2025-05-01","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:57:39","2025-02-26","","","","383","","Agric.

This study was carried out during three growing seasons (2011, 2013, and 2014) in a replicated field experiment, cropped to either barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The experiment included three treatments in a randomized complete block design with four replicates: zero N amendment (CON), liquid pig manure (LPM) at a rate of 56,000 L ha-1 yr? 1, and urea (FER) at N rate matching the total available N content in the manure. In all three years, crop yield and N uptake were slightly higher in the LPM treatment compared to the FER treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant. In 2011 and 2014, when applied N rate was moderate but the application time coincided with a long period of drought, cumulative N2O emissions, emission intensity and factor were significantly higher in the FER treatment than in LPM treatment. In 2013, however, when applied manure N was relatively high, and soil moisture mostly adequate, no such effect was observed. Soil available N content, temperature, and moisture together were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with N2O emission in both LPM and FER samples, and explained about 40 % of the overall variability of N2O emission. We conclude that the use of liquid manure N in cropping system is an environmentally advisable strategy. However, from both nutrient management planning and N2O emission reduction stand points, the results of this study highlight the challenges associated with manure N variability, and emphasis the need for applying manure based on its known N content in addition to soil N test, so that application rate can meet the crop N demand and minimize N2O emissions.","2021-06-15","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:58:58","2021-04-24","","","","313","","Agric.

A two-year field experiment was conducted to assess whether this negative effect is alleviated by improved crop residue management (CRM). Nine treatments (3 CRM and 3 N fertilizer rates) were used. The CRM treatments were (1) R0: 100 % of the N using mineral fertilizer with no crop residues return; (2) R: crop residue plus mineral fertilizer as for the R0; and (3) Rc: crop residue plus 83 % of the N using mineral and 17 % manure fertilizer. Each CRM received N fertilizer rates at 270, 360, and 450 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). At the end of the experiment, soil NO3-N was reduced by 33 % from the R relative to the R0 treatment, while the Rc treatment resulted in a 21 to 44 % increase in occluded particulate organic C and N, and 80 A degrees C extracted dissolved organic N, 19 to 32 % increase in microbial biomass C and protease activity, and higher monounsaturated phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA):saturated PLFA ratio from stimulating growth of indigenous bacteria when compared with the R treatment. Principal component analysis showed that the Biolog and PLFA profiles in the three CRM treatments were different from each other. Overall, these properties were not influenced by the used N fertilizer rates. Our results indicated that application of 17 % of the total N using manure in a field with crop residues return was effective for improving potential plant N availability and labile soil organic matter, primarily due to a shift in the dominant microorganisms.","2016-09","2025-08-27 10:53:07","2025-08-27 10:56:34","2016-09-28","17581-17591","","17","23","","Environ.

Compost distribution (COM1, COM2) and minimum tillage (MT) were compared to conventional management (CONV) in a maize-based cropping system. COM1, MT, and CONV each received 130 kg N ha(-1) in compost or urea form. A double dose was applied to COM2 while the plowed control plots (ON) were not fertilized. Fertilizers were applied for three years (from 2006 to 2008); residual soil fertility was assessed during the fourth year (2009).Results suggested that only the SOC protection strategy via MT could be agronomically sustainable in the high clay content soil near Napoli. There, a short-term SOC increase was recorded with either compost or MT application. In fact, in the same soil, compost use depressed both yield and N availability for maize, which we attribute to the reduction of SOM mineralization due to hydrophobic protection by added humified organic matter coupled with soil physical protection. Compost addition increased SOC (55.1% of added C) in the soil near Torino, where high native N availability buffered its low mineralization and allowed high yields. Alternatively, MT showed no effect on short-term C dynamics, probably because the low organic matter protection favored oxidation and mineralization of root-derived C. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Proper N management is essential to maximize N efficiency and sustain agricultural production while minimizing negative impacts on the environment. The aim of the present study was to investigate N dynamics, maize yields and soil fertility in response to short term compost application and straw return vs. inorganic fertilization. A field experiment (2012-2014) was conducted for three years on a calcareous soil in Quzhou county, Heibei province, north China. There were four treatments: unfertilized control (T1), inorganic fertilizer (100% NPK, T2), compost (cattle wastes) + 70% NPK (T3), T3 + wheat straw (T4). No significant differences in biomass accumulation or N uptake among the fertilized treatments were observed across the maize growing season. Compost application for three years tended to increase grain yields particularly in the second and third years, and the average yield increase was approximately 7-15% over T2. Residual N-min down the soil profile (1 m) in the compost treatments (T3 and T4) decreased by 50% deeper in the soil (60-100 cm depth) at the maize harvest in 2014. Compared to T2, the compost treatments significantly increased NUE and soil available P and K contents. Correlation analysis indicates that maize yield in 2014 was significantly correlated with soil available P and K and with soil organic carbon (SOC). Overall, straw return did not have a significant influence on any measured parameters in either soil or plant samples. Our results demonstrate that 30% replacement of N fertilizer by compost is an effective nutrient management strategy to maintain N uptake and yield of maize, reduce N loss and also increase soil fertility. A considerable increase in invertase activity in the compost treatments highlights that the critical importance of integrating the management of carbon and nitrogen for sustainable agricultural production in this region of highly intensive production.

How milk vetch organic fertilization affects the specific roles of P cycling functional genes in soil and, in turn, the mechanisms of altered P turnover remain unclear. Soil samples were taken from a 10-year field experiment that included mineral fertilizer and partial substitution of mineral fertilizer with milk vetch, together with an unfertilized control. The P-cycling functional genes in soil determined by metagenomics were related to phosphatase enzyme activities and P fractions with various availability. Milk vetch substitution decreased soil total P and NaHCO3-OP (8 and 65 %) but maintain similar available P and high phosphatase activities compared with mineral fertilizer, indicating a net solubilization/ mineralization of soil P occurring in response to milk vetch substitution. The Proteobacteria, followed by Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae, Verrucomicrobia, and Gemmatimonadetes were the most abundant bacteria phyla involved in soil P-cycling. Shifts in P-cycling functional gene community were more related to soil total N and the ratio of SOC to total P. The relative abundance of P-cycling functional genes, increased the production of PQQ-GDH (gcd, pqqE), fumaric acid (fumC), acetic acid (aldh), acid phosphatase (phoN), alkaline phosphatase (phoD), the catabolism of organophosphonates (phnJ, phnN, and phnW) and the dissimilation of glycerol-3-phosphate (glpB, glpF, and glpR) by 4 %-80 %. Phosphatase activities increased with milk vetch substitution, because of raised abundance of related genes and gene-harboring communities (especially Chloroflexi). The phoN gene was the key predictor of organic P mineralization and thus available P. Overall, milk vetch substitution increased the P-acquiring enzyme activities and boosted the involvement of the functional genes in P cycling, which in turn stimulated P bioavailability. These results highlight the connections between milk vetch substitution and P cycling functional genes, which also have implications for offsetting the future demand for P mineral fertilizer by milk vetch substitution in agricultural systems.","2025-09","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:57:40","2025-07-11","","","","213","","Appl.

Based on a 29-year field experiment in Mollisol, the compositions and changes of P forms using a modified Hedley sequential extraction method, solution P-31-NMR and P K-edge XANES and soil properties were investigated under continuous mono maize with and without manure (NPKM and NPK). Results showed a stronger positive related coefficient between soil total P and labile P, and mid-labile P fraction was found in NPKM than in NPK treatment. It indicated NPKM could improve the availability of soil accumulated P and reduce its transformation to stable P. Accumulated inorganic P (Pi) was dominated by aluminum phosphate (Al-P) and monobasic calcium phosphate monohydrate (MCP) for NPK treatment, Al-P, MCP, and tricalcium phosphate for NPKM treatment with XANES analysis, which contributed to the P availability in Mollisol. Moreover, the proportion of IHP with XANES and ratio of orthophosphate diesters to monoesters in NPK compared to NPKM indicated the higher Po lability with NPK treatment. Pi, especially NaHCO3-Pi and NaOH-Pi, were the potential sources of resin-Pi. Soil organic matter (SOM), organic-bound iron, and alumina oxide (Fe-p + Al-p) showed significant influence on the transformation of P forms. Our research suggested that due to the rise in SOM and Fe-p + Al-p, the fertilization regime significantly increased most highly active soil P fractions, especially in NPKM treatment.

We investigated the soil constituents that contribute to the accumulation of U by using chemical extraction methods. Surface soil samples were obtained from upland fields, pastures, and paddy fields cultivated without any phosphate fertilizer (control site), with NPK fertilizer (NPK site), and with both NPK fertilizer and compost (NPK + compost site) for more than 20 years. In addition to the total U (U-t) concentration in soil, the concentrations of pyrophosphate- and acid oxalate-extractable U were determined as a measure of U associated with soil organic matter and poorly crystalline Fe/Al minerals in soil, respectively. The total, pyrophosphate-extractable, and acid oxalate-extractable U concentrations were higher in the soil obtained from the NPK and NPK + compost sites than in that obtained from the control site. The difference in the U concentrations between the NPK or NPK + compost site and the control site corresponded with the increased U concentration observed after the application of the phosphate fertilizer or both the fertilizer and compost. in the upland field and pasture soil, the increase in pyrophosphate-extractable U was 83-94% of that in U-t On the other hand, the increase in acid oxalate-extractable U was 44-58% of that in U-t in the upland field and pasture soil, but it was almost equivalent to the increase in U-t in the paddy soil with NPK. In conclusion, most of the phosphate fertilizer-derived U was either incorporated into the soil organic matter or poorly crystalline Fe/Al minerals in the surface soil of agricultural fields. Thus, soil organic matter is an important pool of U in upland field and pasture soil, whereas poorly crystalline Fe/Al minerals are important pools of U in paddy soil experiencing alternating changes in redox conditions.

However, little is known about the relative contributions of soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) to nitrous oxide (N2O) production during ammonia oxidation in response to the additions of diverse types of OMs in the tropical soil for vegetable production. Herein, the soils were sampled from a tropical vegetable field subjected to 4-year consecutive amendments of straw or manure. All the soils were amended with ammonium sulfate ((NH4)(2)SO4, applied at a dose of 150 mg N kg(-1)) and incubated aerobically for four weeks under 50% water holding capacity. 1-octyne or acetylene inhibition technique was used to differentiate the relative contributions of AOA and AOB to N2O production. Results showed that AOA dominated N2O production in soil managements of unfertilized control (CK), chemical fertilization (NPK), and NPK with straw (NPKS), whereas AOB contributed more in soil under NPK with manure (NPKM). Straw addition stimulated AOA-dependent N2O production by 94.8% despite the decreased AOA amoil abundance. Moreover, manure incorporation triggered both AOA- and AOB-dependent N2O production by 1472% and 233.7%, respectively, accompanied with increased AOA and AOB abundances. Those stimulating effects were stronger for AOB, owing to its sensitivity to the alleviated soil acidification and decreased soil C/N ratio. Our findings highlight the stimulated N2O emissions during ammonia oxidation by historical OM amendments in tropical vegetable soil, with the magnitude of those priming effects dependent on the types of OM, and appropriate measures need to be taken to counter this challenge in tropical agriculture ecosystems.

In particular, it is a significant source of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and a large consumer of water resources, while arsenic levels in the grain are a serious health concern. There is also a tendency to use more organic fertilisers to close nutrient cycles, posing a threat of even higher GHG emissions and grain arsenic levels. It has been shown that alternate wetting and drying (AWD) water management reduces both water use and GHG emissions, but success at maintaining yields varies. This study tested the effect of early AWD (e-AWD) versus continuous flooding (CF) water management practices on grain yields, GHG emissions and grain arsenic levels in a split-plot field experiment with organic fertilisers under organic management. The treatments included: i) farmyard manure, ii) compost, and iii) biogas digestate, alone or in combination with mineral fertiliser. The e-AWD water regime showed no difference in yield for the organic treatments. Yields significantly increased by 5-16 % in the combination treatments. Root biomass and length increased in the e-AWD treatments up to 72 and 41 %, respectively. The e-AWD water regime reduced seasonal CH4 emissions by 71-85 % for organic treatments and by 51-76 % for combination treatments; this was linked to a 15-47 % reduction in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), thereby reducing methanogenesis. N2O emissions increased by 23-305 % but accounted for < 20 % of global warming potential (GWP). Area and yield-scaled GWPs were reduced by 67-83 %. The e-AWD regime altered soil redox potentials, resulting in a reduction in grain arsenic and lead concentrations of up to 66 % and 73 % respectively. Grain cadmium levels were also reduced up to 33 % in organic treatments. Structural equation modelling showed that DOC, redox, ammonium and root biomass were the key traits that regulated emissions and maintained yield. Despite the fact that the experiment was conducted in the dry-season when soil moisture conditions can be relatively well-controlled, our findings should be confirmed in multi-year studies in farmers' fields. These results suggest that in flooded rice systems receiving organic amendments or organic management, the e-AWD water regime can achieve multiple environmental and food safety objectives without compromising yield.","2020-06-15","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:59:20","2020-06-16","","","","295","","Agric.

However, such research is essential, particularly for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions, to address the triple challenges of sustainable agriculture, food and fiber security, and environmental degradation.Objectives: This study aimed to investigate changes in soil quality and cotton-greengram system productivity following long-term nutrient management and to establish a quantitative relationship between the soil quality index and system productivity.Methods: A study was conducted from 2017 to 21 in a long-term field experiment initiated in 1987 with eight treatment combinations, including sole organics ('ANFYM, 'ANGli), inorganics (NPK, 'ANK), and the integration of organics to substitute for the fertilizer-N requirement (INM) [(N + NGli)PK, (N + NFYM)PK, (NGli)PK] in the cotton-greengram intercropping system of the semi-arid region in Maharashtra, India. Surface soil samples (0-0.2 m) were collected and analyzed for different physical, chemical, and biological properties to develop a soil quality index. The soil quality index was then validated against the system productivity.Result: The INM treatments, where 50 % N was substituted by Gliricidia [(N + NGli)PK] or FYM [(N + NFYM)PK], demonstrated significantly higher cotton-greengram system productivity, sustainable yield index, and soil quality index, while the lowest values were observed in the control. Soil organic carbon (SOC), available nitrogen (N), mean weight diameter, and alkaline phosphatase were identified as the key soil quality indicators. The predictive relationship between system productivity and soil quality index revealed that maintaining 6.5 g kg-1 (chromic acid oxidizable) SOC and 253 kg (potassium permanganate oxidizable) available N ha-1 in the soil of semi-arid climates is crucial for sustaining cropping system productivity.Conclusion: INM that encourages balanced fertilization must include partial N supplementation by FYM/Glir-icidia as part of the nutrient application package in semi-arid Vertisols.Implications/significance: Our study highlights the significance of adopting sustainable agricultural practices to achieve optimal soil conditions for maximum productivity in semi-arid regions. This knowledge can benefit farmers and researchers globally in optimizing INM practices for different crops and agroecological zones, aiding in the development of sustainable farming strategies and ensuring food-fiber security while preserving soil quality and protecting the environment.","2023-11-01","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:49","2023-10-18","","","","303","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001077708000001","","","17 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet it remains unclear how the optimized manure and effluent additions may affect gas (nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia (NH3)) emissions during wheat cultivation. Materials and methods We conducted a field experiment in Zhuzhen (Jiangsu), China, from November 2018 to May 2019 to examine the effects of effluent and manure on gas emissions from the wheat fields that had seven treatments (4 replicates, 28 plots): no fertilizer (control); inorganic fertilizer at a conventional application rate of 200 kg N ha(-1) (NPK); 100 kg N ha(-1) inorganic fertilizer plus 100 (DE1), 150 (DE2), and 250 (DE3) kg N ha(-1) farm dairy effluent; 100 kg N ha(-1) inorganic fertilizer plus 100 kg N ha(-1) farm dairy manure (SM1); and 150 kg N ha(-1) inorganic fertilizer plus 50 kg N ha(-1) farm dairy manure (SM2). Results and discussion Applying dairy effluent during the wheat season significantly (P < 0.05) increased NH3 emissions from 1.83 (NPK) to 3.81 kg N ha(-1) (DE1) and 11.4 kg N ha(-1) (DE3), probably due to elevated levels of soil NH4+ and pH, with no discernable impact on N2O emissions compared with NPK. The greater application of effluent in the DE3 treatment increased NO emissions significantly by 33.3% relative to NPK. The combined application of manure and urea significantly reduced N2O and NO emissions by 25.2-27.6% and 8.3-45.8%, respectively, but increased NH3 emissions in the SM1 treatment by 73.8%, when compared with NPK. Conclusions Overall, our results suggest that replacing 25% of the current conventional chemical N application rate with dairy manure could considerably mitigate gas emissions in the wheat season.","2021-06","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:58:54","2021-03-26","2381-2393","","6","21","","J.

Exploration of the restorative effect of organic manure on the soil fertility, quality and sustainable productivity is urgently needed. A 4-year field experiment (2011-2014) investigated variation of grain yield, soil water-nutrient content and plant growth in a local cultivar (Zheng Dan 958) of maize (Zea mays L.) at three planting densities with extra organic manure application in a semi-arid region of Northwestern China. Soil water content in 0-50 cm and below 150 cm soil profile was maintained stably at 25% and 18% under organic manure application over four consecutive years, and soil water use in the depth of 50-150 cm was improved. Organic manure helped residual soil nutrient mineralization after harvest with 25%, 198% and 41% increases in total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P) and soil organic matter (SOM) over three years respectively. Adequate content of N, P and SOM after maize harvest played an important role for stable high yield in the next season. Consequently, the biomass allocation into shoot and grains was optimized and presented as a slight increase in harvest index (HI). Based on the improvement of water-nutrient status in manured soil, maize water productivity (WP) increased by 3-8%, which positively associated with the yield increase by 5-10% at high planting density. Organic manure could be used to improve soil environment, promote yield and WP in maize in dryland agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Organic amendments are anticipated to enrich the soil with organic carbon and enhance the soil faunal abundance. However, the specific mechanisms by which soil fauna regulates carbon accumulation under these organic amendments are not fully elucidated. We carried out a six-year field experiment including no fertilizer application, conventional chemical fertilizer, and partial substitutions of urea with maize straw and cattle manure. We aimed to explore the connections between soil faunal community and carbon fractions under organic amendments. Our findings indicated that organic amendments elevated SOC and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) by 16.7 %-25.9 % and 7.5 %-10.1 %, respectively, relative to the unfertilized control. Fertilization regimes modified the composition of arthropod and nematode communities. Notably, Prostigmata and Oribatida positively correlated with microbial necromass carbon, while nematode community composition was positively associated with neutral sugar accumulation. Under manure amendment, the concentration of neutral sugar positively correlated with the ratio of MAOC to particulate organic carbon (POC). Moreover, compared with conventional chemical fertilizer, straw amendment increased total nematode biomass by 71.4 % and energy flux by 67.3 %, enhancing plant-derived carbon formation through root energy pathways. In contrast, manure amendment increased fungivorous nematodes' relative carbon flux to 18.6 %, showing preferential fungal-mediated carbon channeling. These differential effects underscore the significance of integrating faunal-mediated processes into strategies for managing soil carbon dynamics and developing sustainable agroecosystem fertilization practices.","2025-08","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:56","2025-06-12","","","","212","","Appl.

This two-year field experiment was conducted in the North China Plain. The field experiment was undertaken with a split-plot design; the primary plots were winter fallow (WF) and green manure (GM), and the split-plots were five N application rates of 0 (N0), 189 (N189), 216 (N216), 243 (N243), and 270 (N270) kg ha(-1). The results showed that, spring maize GY under GM treatments (GY(GM)) were significantly increased by 5.38-11.68% more than WF treatment (GY(WF)), and GY(WF) and GY(GM) significantly increased by 35.9-91.5% and 80.1-135.5% across all N treatments. By linear-platform model analysis, spring maize under GM treatments obtained higher GY, reaching 1270.5-14,312.2 kg ha(-1) with optimized N application rate at 238-265 kg ha(-1), which resulted in a GY higher than WF (11,820.0 and 13,654.2 kg ha(-1)) and N reduced 11.2% (238 vs. 268 kg ha(-1)). GM treatment significantly increased soil organic carbon by 3.90-12.23% more than WF over all N application rates, and total nitrogen and available nitrogen were significantly increased by 3.79-15.76% and 4.87-17.29%, with total phosphorus and available phosphorus for GM higher than WF by 6.1-13.6% and 9.6-5.3%, respectively. However, there were lesser effects of GM on total potassium and available potassium. Compared to WF, soil catalase, sucrose, urease, and alkaline phosphatase activity were significantly increased by 6.2-16.4%, 5.8-48.1%, 3.3-21.5% and 11.5-82.3%, respectively, over all N application rates under GM over two years. GM increased Zygomycota and Basidiomycota relative abundances significantly, and reduced Thielavia, unclassified fungi, and Podospora relative abundances by 35.35%, 52.92% and 52.77% more than WF treatment, respectively. In summary, due to the GM return into fields, increased soil nutrients were available, which were positively affected by soil enzyme activity and fungal communities, and reduced nutrient requirements, and so the farmers could obtain a spring maize grain yield higher than 14,000 kg ha(-1) with a reduced 11.2% N application rate from 268 kg ha(-1) to 238 kg ha(-1) by sowing winter green manure for a long time period in the North China Plain.","2022-11","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:58:34","2022-11-24","","","11","12","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000883359600001","","","5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But practicing intercropping along with straw return instead of the use of chemical fertilizer have the potential to reverse the decline and improve soil organic carbon (SOC) content. A field experiment with five treatments at two sites of Songnen Plain of Northeast China included the following treatments (1) corn monoculture with no chemical fertilizers and no straw return (c), (2) corn monoculture with chemical fertilizers and no straw return (c + F), (3) corn-yellow melilot intercropping and straw return combined with full application of chemical fertilizers (c&m + S + F), (4) corn-yellow melilot intercropping and straw return combined with half dose of chemical fertilizers (c&m + S + F/2), and (5) corn-yellow melilot intercropping and straw return without chemical fertilizers (c&m + S).

Organic fertilizer (OF) shows potential to promote MPs degradation. However, little is known about the influence of OF incorporated with coated urea on MPs accumulation, NUE, and gaseous N loss (NH3 3 and N2O) 2 O) in paddies. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to address this gap, with five fertilization treatments, viz., urea (un-coated) with full rates (U), coated urea with full rates (CU), coated urea with reduced rates (RCU), 70 % coated urea blending 30% urea with reduced rates (RBU), and RBU blending OF (ORBU). The results showed that, compared with U, the CU increased the number of MPs by 62.2-117.4 %. The ORBU significantly reduced the weight of MPs by 53.2 % through decreasing large-particle size. Additionally, the ORBU enhanced the effect of CU on increasing grain yield and NUE, mainly due to the improvement in the yield components and N uptake. The distribution of NH4+ 4 + in water and soil was a major factor driving NH3 3 and N2O 2 O emissions. The ORBU elevated activities of N-assimilation enzymes, decreased water NH4+ 4 + and NH3 3 emissions, and increased soil NH4+ 4 + and ammonium-oxidation bacteria and ( nirK + nirS )/ nosZ , ultimately increased soil N2O 2 O emissions compared with RBU. However, the reduction in NH3 3 much outweighed the increase in N2O 2 O emissions. In conclusion, this study highlighted coated urea as a source of MPs pollution, emphasized OF amendment as a strategy to diminish MPs accumulation, and found that OF incorporated with coated urea could increase grain yield and N uptake of rice while mitigating gaseous N loss in paddies.","2024-11-01","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:31","2024-08-09","","","","375","","Agric.

Results showed that irrigation did not affect annual N2O emissions of the wheat-maize system. Manure application (Fc + m and Fm) reduced annual N2O emissions by 25-51% compared with Fc, which mainly occurred during 2 weeks after fertilization combined with irrigation (or heavy rainfall). In particular, Fc + m reduced the cumulative N2O emissions during 2 weeks after winter wheat sowing and summer maize top dressing by 0.28 and 0.11 kg ha-1, respectively, compared with Fc. Meanwhile, Fm maintained the grain N yield and Fc + m increased grain N yield by 8% compared with Fc under W1. Overall, Fm maintained the annual grain N yield and lower N2O emissions compared to Fc under W0, and Fc + m increased the annual grain N yield and maintained N2O emissions compared with Fc under W1, respectively.

With a six-month field experiment, we found that swine manure -fertilized soil had significantly higher ARG abundance than soil applied with chemical fertilizer. As expected, the homemade fermentation broth significantly reduced ARG abundance in swine manure-fertilized soil, possibly through the decrease of abundance of Actinomyces, in which there was a 48.0%, 51.9%, and 66.7% decrease in the abundance of Nocardioides, Streptomyces, and Nonomuraea, respectively.

Previous studies have confirmed that returning green manure to the field is an effective measure to improve crop yields while substituting partial chemical N fertilizer. However, it remains unclear how to further intensify the substituting function of green manure and elucidate its underlying agronomic mechanism. In a split-plot field experiment in spring wheat, different green manures returned to the field under reduced chemical N supply was established in an oasis area since 2018, in order to investigate the effect of green manure and reduced N on grain yield, N uptake, N use efficiency (NUE), N nutrition index, soil organic matter, and soil N of wheat in 2020-2022. Our results showed that mixed sown common vetch and hairy vetch can substitute 40% of chemical N fertilizer without reducing grain yield or N accumulation. Noteworthily, mixed sown common vetch and hairy vetch under reduced N by 20% showed the highest N agronomy efficiency and recovery efficiency, which were 92.0% and 46.0% higher than fallow after wheat harvest and conventional N application rate, respectively. The increase in NUE of wheat was mainly attributed to mixed sown common vetch and hairy vetch, which increased N transportation quantity and transportation rate at pre-anthesis, enhanced N harvest index, optimized N nutrition index, and increased activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase of leaf, respectively. Meanwhile, mixed sown common vetch and hairy vetch under reduced N by 20% improved soil organic matter and N contents. Therefore, mixed sown common vetch and hairy vetch can substitute 40% of chemical N fertilizer while maintaining grain yield and N accumulation, and it combined with reduced chemical N by 20% or 40% improved NUE of wheat via enhancing N supply and uptake.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of replacing traditional winter fallow with a cover crop combined with a reduced amount of nitrogen (N) fertilizer on ammonia (NH3) volatilization, GHG emissions, and cotton production yield. A field experiment was performed with two cropping systems (a single cotton system and February orchid (Orychophragmus violaceus L.) incorporated into a single cotton cropping system) and four N levels (0, 112.5, 168.75 and 225.0 kg N ha(-1)). The results showed that the incorporation of February orchid increased cotton yield, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, NH3 volatilization, global warming po-tential (GWP), and net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) under the same N application rate. Moreover, the NH3, N2O, GWP, yield GWP, and NECB increased with an increasing N application rate. Furthermore, the correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA) results indicated that N2O emissions and NH3 volatilization were positively affected by soil NO3--N, total nitrogen (TN) and lint cotton yield. Overall, compared with the single cropping of cotton with conventional fertilization, the incorporation of February orchid with a 25% reduction in the N application rate decreased NH3 volatilization by 1.05 kg NH3-N ha(-1) and N2O losses by 0.34 kg N2O-N ha(-1) and resulted in a favorable cotton yield. Our results demonstrate that replacing traditional winter fallow with a cover crop combined with a N fertilizer reduction may help to mitigate soil GHG emissions and NH3 volatilization while ensuring yield in cotton production.

Use of the right amounts of vermicompost as an important source of nitrogen and its replacement for urea will guaranty soil quality and health for the future generations. In this context, a field experiment was carried out to compare application of vermicompost and urea and their combinations as a source of N fertilizers in the research farm of Shahrood University of Technology (Iran) in April 2010. After standardizing the inorganic nitrogen contents in the soil 5 levels of N fertilizers (control, 100% vermicompost, 66.6% vermicompost + 33.3% urea, 66.6% urea + 33.3% vermicompost and 100% urea) were selected and were used in two local cultivars of coriander ('Hamedani' and 'Isfahani'). The results of this experiment showed that use of vermicompost and urea on their own significantly (P <= 0.05) increased seed yield (36.2 and 53.5% respectively). Combination of vermicompost and urea (66.6 and 33.3% respectively) also increased seed yield (112.1%). The same trend was found for total dry weight. There were no significant differences between 2 cultivars related to dry weight and seed yield. It is speculated that vermicompost has the potential to replace for urea in coriander farming.

However, unreasonable fertilization strategies result in high levels of residual P in vegetable planting systems. To better understand the mechanisms of soil phosphorus dynamics responding to inorganic/organic fertilization, we conducted a 3-year field experiment in two newly reclaimed vegetable fields in southern China. The results revealed that soil Olsen-P in CF (mineral fertilization) and OF (Combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers) increased by approximately 210.6 % and 183.6 %, respectively, while stable P proportion decreased by approximately 9.2 % and 18.1 %, respectively, compared with CK. Combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer increased the proportion of moderately labile P (NaOHP) by 1-6 % in comparison with chemical fertilizer and facilitated the conversion from diester-P to monoester-P, indicating that applying pig manure enhanced the potential soil P bioavailability. Besides, organic-inorganic fertilization shaped a bacterial community with more connectivity and stability and changed keystone taxa related to the P transformation of the network. Phenylobacterium, Solirubrobacter, and Modestobacter were regarded as core genera for mobilizing soil phosphorus. However, residual P content in newly reclaimed soils under fertilization, especially for chemical fertilizer, remained non-negligible and may cause potential environmental risks. The partial least squares path modeling results demonstrated that fertilization management had both direct and indirect positive effects on P fraction through the improvement of soil nutrients e.g. total N and soil organic carbon, and bacterial community, while soil properties mainly determined the variation of soil P species. Our results provide comprehensive insights into the current status of legacy P forms and the vital role of fertilizer, key soil properties and bacteria in P dynamics in newly reclaimed vegetable field.","2024-02-20","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:32","2024-01-24","","","","912","","Sci.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of mineral and organic N fertilizers on the nitrification and denitrification processes, and consequently on N2O and NO emissions. Therefore, a field experiment was carried out on an irrigated sandy loam soil under Mediterranean conditions during the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season. Untreated pig slurry (UPS) both with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (UPS + DCD), digested thin pig slurry fraction (DTP), composted solid fraction of slurry mixed with urea (CPS + U) and composted municipal solid waste mixed with urea (MSW + U) were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha(-1). Their emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment to which no nitrogen fertilization was administered (Control). Accumulated nitrous oxide losses during the crop season ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the Control and CPS + U, respectively, whereas nitric oxide losses ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 kg NO-N ha(-1), for the Control and U, respectively. The use of digested slurries mitigated N2O emission by 25% in relation to untreated pig slurry, but NO emissions were similar for both treatments. Dicyandiamide reduced N2O and NO emissions by 64 and 78% with respect to slurry without the inhibitor. An indirect effect of DCD on denitrification was also observed, with a reduction of 32% in denitrification with respect to the slurry without the inhibitor. In this case, the greatest reduction in denitrification losses occurred during the irrigation period. Composts mixed with urea reduced NO emissions by 56% (CPS + U) and 85% (MSW + U) in relation to the urea treatment, but its effect on N2O depended on the type of compost involved: CPS + U increased NO emission by 27%, whereas MSW + U reduced it by 55% in relation to urea. Denitrification was the most important process responsible for N2O emissions when organic fertilizers were applied to the soil, while nitrification was the most important for the inorganic fertilizer. The C:N ratio of fertilizers was a good predictor of their NO emissions, denitrification losses and N2O/N-2 ratio. On the other hand, added soluble N was a good predictor for cumulative N2O emissions during the period before irrigation. This work shows that an appropriate selection of organic fertilizers based on their composition could be used to mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and NO in comparison with urea.

Protecting these soils with a specific focus on revitalizing their C sequestration potential emerges as a crucial measure to address various threats associated with climate change. In this study, we employed a modeling approach to assess the impact of different fertilization strategies on crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, and C sequestration efficiency (CSE) under various climate change scenarios (baseline, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5). The process-based SPACSYS model was calibrated and validated using data from two representative Mollisol long-term experiments in Northeast China, including three crops (wheat, maize and soyabean) and four fertilizations (no-fertilizer (CK), mineral nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK), manure only (M), and chemical fertilizers plus M (NPKM or NM)). SPACSYS effectively simulated crop yields and the dynamics of SOC stock. According to SPACSYS projections, climate change, especially the increased temperature, is anticipated to reduce maize yield by an average of 14.5% in Harbin and 13.3% in Gongzhuling, and soybean yield by an average of 10.6%, across all the treatments and climatic scenarios. Conversely, a slight but not statistically significant average yield increase of 2.5% was predicted for spring wheat. SOC stock showed a decrease of 8.2% for Harbin and 7.6% for Gonghzuling by 2,100 under the RCP scenarios. Future climates also led to a reduction in CSE by an average of 6.0% in Harbin (except NPK) and 13.4% in Gongzhuling. In addition, the higher average crop yields, annual SOC stocks, and annual CSE (10.15-15.16%) were found when manure amendments were performed under all climate scenarios compared with the chemical fertilization. Soil CSE displayed an exponential decrease with the C accumulated input, asymptotically approaching a constant. Importantly, the CSE asymptote associated with manure application was higher than that of other treatments. Our findings emphasize the consequences of climate change on crop yields, SOC stock, and CSE in the Mollisol regions, identifying manure application as a targeted fertilizer practice for effective climate change mitigation.","2024-04-02","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:23","2024-04-20","","","","8","","Front.

The results indicated that compared to the chemical fertilizer treatment, the biogas slurry treatment increased soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and organic nitrogen contents by 16.4%, 35.0%, and 26.3%, respectively. The biogas slurry treatment led to decreases of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Pb, and Hg content by 12.6%, 14.6%, 9.25%, 32.2%, 30.1%, 12.1%, 24.0%, and 61.5%, respectively. Additionally, the Chinese cabbage yield increased by 10.0% in the biogas slurry treatment group.

The field experiment included seven treatments: no N fertilizer (Control); 200/300 kg N ha(-1) synthetic N fertilizer only (wheat/maize) (CN); 100/150 kg N ha(-1) synthetic N fertilizer plus 100/150 (DE1), 150/200 (DE2) and 250/350 (DE3) kg N ha(-1) dairy effluent; 100/150 kg N ha(-1) synthetic fertilizer plus 100/150 kg N ha(-1) dairy manure (SM1); and 150/225 kg N ha(-1) synthetic fertilizer plus 50/75 kg N ha(-1) dairy manure (SM2). Compared with CN, DE1 treatment increased maize yield by 10.0 %, wheat N use efficiency (NUE) by 26.5 %, and wheat and maize N uptake by 7.7-16.3 %, while reduced N leaching by 22.4 % in wheat season and by 40.4 % in the maize season. In contrast, DE2 and DE3 treatment increased N leaching by 27.2-241 % and reduced NUE by 26.2-55.2 %.

The field experiment includes four treatments: 100% N fertilizer (CF), 50% substitution of N fertilizer with manure (M), straw (S), and manure plus straw (MS). The amounts of nutrient (N, P2O5, and K2O) input were equal in each treatment. Results showed higher values of mean weight diameter in organic-amended soils (M, MS, and S, 2.43-2.97) vs. CF-amended soils (1.99). Relative to CF treatment, organic amendments had positive effects on nutrient (i.e., available N, P, and soil organic C (SOC)) conditions, microbial (e.g., bacterial and fungal) growth, and EEAs in the >0.053 mm aggregates, but not in the <0.053 mm aggregates. The 0.25-0.053 mm aggregates exhibited better nutrient conditions and hydrolytic activity, while the <0.053 mm aggregates had poor nutrient conditions and higher oxidative activity among aggregates, per SOC, available N, available P, and a series of enzyme activities. These results indicated that the 0.25-0.053 mm (<0.053 mm) aggregates provide suitable microhabitats for hydrolytic (oxidative) activity. Interestingly, we found that hydrolytic and oxidative activities were mainly impacted by fertilization (58.5%, P<0.01) and aggregate fractions (50.5%, P<0.01), respectively.

However, the optimal substitution rate of MV for CF and its long-term effects on crop productivity and soil quality remain unknown. We conducted a 13-year field experiment with different substitution rates of MV for CF (22.5 t ha(-1) fresh MV incorporation with 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40% of the recommended nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) supply, represented by MV+F-100, MV+F-80, MV+F-60 and MV+F-40, respectively) to investigate its long-term effects on yield sustainability and soil quality in double rice cropping system. Compared with the sole application of CF, the MV+F-100 and MV+F-80 treatments signifi-cantly increased the early rice yields by 15.6% and 11.3% and the late rice yields by 9.3% and 6.3%, respectively. Utilization of MV to substitute 0-40% of the N and K in early rice season and 0-20% of the N and K in late rice season significantly increased the soil quality index (SQI). However, further increasing the substitution rate decreased the sustainability yield index (SYI) and SQI. The soil available phosphorus had a stronger effect on the early and late rice grain yield than the other soil physicochemical properties. Meanwhile, rice grain yields significantly increased with increasing SQI, and the apparent N, P and K balances positively affects SQI. The SYIs of early and late rice crops linearly increased with increasing SQIs, while the coefficient of variance in grain yield (CVy) decreased with increasing SQI. Consequently, long-term utilization of MV to substitute 0-40% of the N and K in early rice season and 0-20% of the N and K in late rice season can simultaneously improves yield sus-tainability and soil quality.","2023-01","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:58:08","2022-11-13","","","","142","","Eur.

A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of intercropping green manure with reduced N on maize productivity and carbon mitigation in northwestern China. The field experiment used a split-plot design with three replicates. Three cropping patterns were maize-common vetch intercropping (M/V), maize-rape intercropping (M/R), and sole maize (M). Two N fertilizer rates formed the subplots: the conventional N rate was reduced by 25% (N1: 270 kg ha-1) and the conventional N rate (N2: 360 kg ha-1). The compensation effect (TCE, %) was used to quantify the degree of recovery of intercropping green manure on maize grain yield (GY) under N reduction. It was shown by the results that the negative effect of N reduction on maize GY was compensated by intercropping green manure. Maize-common vetch intercropping integrated with N reduction (M/VN1) had a more substantial compensation ef-fect (TCE) with the planting years lengthening, and TCE was 1.0%, 0.9%, 4.1%, and 4.9% in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The CE of the cropping system was decreased by intercropping green manure compared to sole maize. The CE in the intercropping system was further decreased by N reduction, and the CE of M/RN1 and M/VN1 was decreased by 27.7% and 32.1%, respectively, compared to MN2 (i.e., the control). Finally, the CE of the intercropping system was decreased by M/VN1 by 6.5% compared to M/RN1 in 2019-2021. We used the ratio of net primary productivity to carbon emission (NPP/CE) to determine soil C sequestration (CS) potential. Intercropping green manure with N reduction in enhancing soil CS mainly occurred in the late growth period of maize. Over the four years of study, the ratios of NPP/CE for M/RN1 and M/VN1 were 23.3% and 32.9%, respectively, greater than that of MN2; also, it of M/VN1 was increased by 8.9% compared to M/RN1 in 2019-2021. M/VN1 had great potential for enhancing soil CS. Thus, adding green manure as an intercropping component in the maize cropping system while reducing chemical N fertilizer is a promising system to enhance maize productivity and carbon mitigation in the farmlands of arid areas.","2023-04","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:57:09","2023-04-11","","","","145","","Eur.

However, the high temperatures, rainfall and low fertilizer utilization efficiencies lead to fertilizer leaching loss and greenhouse gas emissions, which are very unfavourable to the sustainable production of pineapple. The purpose of this study was to determine whether reducing fertilizer applications could increase pineapple yield, quality and agronomic efficiency and reduce the global warming potential. A 4-year field experiment with five fertilization pattern treatments (e.g., CK: no fertilization; NPK: traditional fertilization; INF: reduced nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium fertilizers; INF + M: based on INF, 20% N was replaced by organic fertilizer; INF + M + S: based on INF, 20% and 15% N were replaced by organic and slow-release fertilizers, respectively) was established to ascertain the potential role of reduced fertilization levels in increasing pineapple yield, quality and agronomic efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The results revealed that compared with the NPK treatment, the INF, INF + M and INF + M + S treatments increased pineapple yields by 8.1%, 13.0% and 27.1% averaged over the two seasons, respectively, and significantly improved the agronomic efficiency and reduced the global warming potential and greenhouse gas emission intensity without compromising quality. In addition, when compared with INF treatment, the INF + M and INF + M + S treatments could significantly reduce the nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions and thus decrease the global warming potential by 21.2% and 29.2%, respectively, and greenhouse gas emission intensity by 32.0% and 32.5%, respectively, averaged over two seasons. However, the INF + M and INF + M + S treatments showed no significant differences. The INF + M + S treatment provided the highest yields, agronomic efficiency and soil methane uptakes among all treatments (p < 0.05). The nitrous oxide and methane emissions showed significant positive correlations with soil moistures and temperatures, respectively. Meanwhile, both nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide showed significant positive correlations with the soil ammonium and nitrate contents. We highly recommend the INF + M + S treatment as an environmentally friendly fertilization strategy for pineapple in tropical regions with high yields, high efficiencies, and low greenhouse gas emissions.","2022-04-01","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:31","2022-06-18","","","","343","","J.

An integrated analysis based on field research and system assessment","Journal of Cleaner Production","","0959-6526","10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121508","","Recycling agriculture is an effective way to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions and improve yield of agricultural systems. The core practice of the recycling agriculture model is to extend the industrial chain of agricultural activities and to return the wasted organic materials that resulted from each step of the recycling chain into farmland for completely treating them. In this context, people is asking a question about if the longer recycling chain means the better effectives on yield growth and agricultural GHGs mitigation. For answering the question, therefore, this study compared the yield and net GHGs emissions by applying mineral fertilizer (CK), rice straw (CS), cow manure (CM), biogas residue (BR) and commercial organic fertilizer (MO) into paddy field during 2017-2018 in the South China. All of the organic materials were derived from the different steps of recycling chain of rice straw. The results indicated that the yields of CS, CM, BR and MO were 9.4%, 12.7%, 19.7% and 14.2% higher than CK, respectively. The field-based net GHGs emissions (NGHGD) of CS, CM, BR and MO were 7.2%, 9.7%, 24.1% and 66.4% lower than the CK, respectively. The results demonstrated that, from the farmland level, extending recycling chain of using rice straw indeed contributed to improving yield and reducing GHGs emissions in paddy field. Nevertheless, if the NGHG accounting of different treatments considered the upstream GHGs emissions under the condition of ignoring substituted effects, the longer recycling chain of using rice straw did not contribute to reducing the NGHG of the whole recycling agriculture pathways. Specifically, the system-based net GHGs emission (NGHG) of CS was decreased by 13.0% compared to the CK, while the indices of CM, BR and MO were increased by 96.0%, 14.7% and 26.6%, respectively. The information will contribute to the development of circular economy and clean production in agricultural systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A 2-year field experiment was carried out using rural FW to grow organic grains in Shandong Province, China. Different proportions of FW and cattle manure were designed: FM0, 100% cattle manure compost (CMC); FM1, 75% CMC + 25% FW; FM2, 50% CMC + 50% FW; FM3, 25% CMC + 75% FW; FM4, 100% FW; CF, 100% chemical fertilizer; CK, without any fertilizers. Compared with CK and FM0, the application of FW significantly increased the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium content of the soil. Simultaneously, all the three indicators increased with the increase of the proportion of FW. FW did not cause increase of contents of heavy metals such as cuprum, zinc, and chromium in the soils, nor did it increase the heavy metals in the grains. Using FW to replace all cattle manure, the total organic yield of grains reached to an average of 18,163 kg ha(-1). We found that 1 kg dry FW could produce 1.64 kg organic grains under organic conditions, with the average net income being 5.42 times that of chemical mode. Our findings may provide an innovative solution for treating rural food wastes, ensuring food safety, and conservating the agriculture ecosystem.","2022-11","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:58:32","2022-07-06","83483-83495","","55","29","","Environ.

However, it is unclear whether incorporation of green manure into the cropping pattern with reduced nitrogen amount can alleviate this situation and enhance carbon sequestration potential. So, a field experiment with split-plot design was set up in 2018 of northwest China, and studied the effects of nitrogen reduction on crop productivity, carbon emissions, and carbon sequestration potential in 2021-2023. The main plots were two cropping patterns, including multiple cropped green manure after wheat harvest (W-G) and fallow after wheat harvest (W). Three nitrogen application levels formed the split-plots, including local conventional nitrogen amount (N3, 180 kg ha-1), nitrogen amount reduced by 15% (N2, 153 kg ha-1) and 30% (N3, 126 kg ha-1). The results showed that W-G increased grain yield of wheat and energy yield of wheat multiple cropped green manure pattern. The multiple cropped green manure after wheat harvest with local conventional nitrogen amount reduced by 15% (W-GN2) had the significant increasing-effect, and increased grain yield of wheat by 9.6% and increased total energy yields by 39.3% compared to fallow after wheat harvest with local conventional nitrogen amount (W-N3). Relative to W-N3, W-GN2 did not significantly increase carbon emissions of wheat season, and increased total carbon emissions of cropping pattern by 11.1%. Compared to multiple cropped green manure after wheat harvest with local conventional nitrogen amount (W-GN3), W-GN2 decreased carbon emissions by 5.8% in wheat season and decreased by 3.9% in the whole cropping pattern. Therefore, WGN2 gained high carbon emission efficiency based on grain yield, and were 9.9% and 11.2% higher than W-N3 and W-GN3, respectively. In addition, W-GN2 enhanced soil total nitrogen, carbon, and organic carbon contents, compared with W-N3, thus increasing soil carbon sequestration potential index (net primary productivity/carbon emissions). We conclude that multiple cropped leguminous green manure after wheat harvest with local conventional nitrogen amount reduced by 15% can enhance crop productivity and carbon sequestration potential of farmland in arid areas.","2024-08","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:57","2024-07-10","","","","365","","J.

The planning of more sustainable open-field horticultural systems (with no synthetic fertilizer supply) can contribute to the reduction of the nutrient surplus. We hypothesized that an artichoke conventional system could be shifted to a sustainable system through mineral fertilizer supply based on expected plant nutrient uptake, return of crop residues in well-defined growth phases, use of fertility-building crops, and crop rotations. Over a 10-year field experiment, three management systems, differing in fertilizer rates, crop sequence (monoculture/rotation with cauliflower), and legume cover crop adoption and management, were compared: (i) improved conventional, (ii) alternative monoculture, and (iii) biannual rotation. We monitored soil conditions at a sampling interval of approximately 3 years. We calculated gross N, P, and K balances for each growing season, and we also monitored soil respiration over the last two growing seasons. On average, the biannual rotation resulted in a well-balanced N budget (72 kg ha(-1) N surplus) compared with improved conventional (160 kg N ha(-1) N surplus) and alternative monoculture (-34 kg ha(-1) deficit) systems. By contrast, compared with the improved conventional system (133 and 116 kg ha(-1) for P and K budgets, respectively), alternative monoculture and biannual rotation systems had negative budgets for P (-9 kg ha(-1) for both alternative systems) and K (-58 and -51 kg ha(-1) for alternative monoculture and biannual rotation systems, respectively) in nine of ten growing seasons. Our results show for the first time that long-term biannual rotation with cauliflower coupled with cover crop use can optimize nutrient fluxes of conventionally grown globe artichoke. Overall, the study proposes a re-design of artichoke cropping systems, provides novel information useful for growers, and verifies that introducing a legume species cover crop is also the most promising approach to foster long-term sustainability.","2017-12","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:59:49","2017-11-19","","","6","37","","Agron.

However, significant uncertainties exist regarding GNM patterns driven by commonly used fertilization practices in croplands. Based on soils collected from 13 long-term fertilization trials spanning over 30 years across China's uplands by using the 15N dilution technique, we found that manure amendment led to the highest increase in GNM (1.9-9.7 folds), followed by straw return (0.8-4.7 folds) and chemical fertilizer application (0.07-3.9 folds), compared to the unfertilized treatment. Fertilization-induced GNM changes were primarily influenced by the initial soil pH in the chemical fertilizer and straw treatments, and by soil clay content in the manure treatment. Application of chemical fertilizer and straw in higher pH soils and manure in higher clayey soils had a greater promotion on GNM, mainly due to the enhanced soil properties (e.g., total dissolved N) and associated microbial attributes (e.g., N-acquiring enzyme activity, bacterial and fungal biomass). Manure amendment also facilitated GNM in low pH soils by promoting microbial attributes. These findings underscore the importance of differentiated fertilization managements at the district level to maximize soil N supply across China's uplands, with prioritizing application of chemical fertilizer and straw in neutral and alkaline soils and manure in acidic and heavier texture soils. This knowledge is crucial for developing policies aimed at buttress food security and reduce soil N loss in China.","2024-11-15","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:57:50","2024-11-15","","","","480","","J.

It is extremely critical to develop effective N management strategies that consider both environmental and agronomic benefits. From 2017 to 2019, a field experiment was conducted to assess the effects of combinations of organic fertilizers (OF, provided at 30, 50, and 70% of the total applied N) and controlled-release urea (CU) on the NUE, N leaching and wheat yield compared with the effects of urea and CU. The results suggested that OF released N slowly in the early stage and showed a significant residual effect, while CU released N quickly in the first 2 months. The OF substitutes with 30-50% CU increased wheat yield by 4.2-9.2%, while the 70%OF+30%CU treatment showed no significant difference relative to the urea treatment. The average maximum apparent NUE recovery (50.4%) was achieved under the 50%OF+50%CU treatment, but the partial factor productivity was not affected by the N type. As the OF application rate increased, the total carbon content increased, and the total N value decreased. The NO 3 - -N and NH 4 + -N concentrations in the OF+CU treatments were lower before the jointing stage but higher from the grain-filling to mature stages than those in the urea treatment. NO 3 - -N and NH 4 + -N were mainly concentrated in the 0-60-cm layer soil by OF substitution, and N leaching to the 60-100-cm soil layer was significantly reduced. Hence, the results suggest that the combination of 30-50% OF with CU synchronizes absorption with availability due to a period of increased N availability in soils and proved to be the best strategy for simultaneously increasing wheat production and reducing N leaching.","2021-12-24","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:31","2022-02-03","","","","12","","Front.

In the first year (2003-04), chemical fertilizers recorded significantly higher yield of crops and application of organic manures recorded 7.3 to 13.3 % reduction in soybean yield and 7.8 to 14.8 % reduction in wheat yield. In the second year (2004-05), soybean yield was on par among the nutrient sources and wheat yield was on par between chemical fertilizers and poultry manure treatment. In the third year (2005-06), application of organic manures recorded similar yields to that of chemical fertilizers and in fact, poultry manure application resulted in 17.5 and 3.2 % higher yields of soybean and wheat, respectively, over the chemical fertilizers. The protein and oil content of soybean was not affected among the treatments but the protein content of wheat was lower in control compared to the application of either chemical or organic manures. At the end of the 3 cropping cycles, soil organic carbon, available N, P, K status and enzyme activity of soil (dehydrogenase and phosphatase activity) were significantly improved in organic manure treatments compared to chemical fertilizers. The economics of soybean - durum wheat cropping system was in favour of chemical fertilizers during the first 2 years but in the third year, organic farming resulted in better economic returns due to improved productivity and lower cost of cultivation compared to chemical farming.","2008-12","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:42","2008-12-01","1033-1037","","12","78","","Indian J.

To objectively evaluate the changes in the SOC over the last two decades, we selected 132 representative articles from these documented articles. More than sixty thousand soil samples and/or sampling sites were included in the selected articles. Results from analyzing these data sets indicated that the concentration of SOC increased in 53%-59%, decreased in 30%-31% and stabilized in 4%-6% of the national croplands, respectively. A further investigation showed that the total increment of SOC in Chinese croplands ranged from 311.3 Tg to 401.4 Tg. In terms of administrative region, significant increase occurred in eastern and northern China and decrease in northeastern China, respectively. When evaluated by soil great groups, the SOC increased considerably in paddy soils and fluvo-aquic soils and reduced conspicuously in black soils. The increase of SOC is attributed to the amendments of crop residues and organic manure, the augment of synthetic fertilizer application and the optimal combination of nutrients, and the development of no-tillage and reduced-tillage practice. Water loss and soil erosion and low input induced a great decrease of the,SOC in black soils. In order to effectively enhance soil C sequestrations and to greatly control the SOC reduction in northeastern China, future efforts should be made in developing new techniques, training farmers and consummating the policy of governmental compensation, by which the application of crop straw, the improvement of fertilization, the practice of no-tillage and reduced-tillage, and the control of water loss and soil erosion could be further realized. To respond to the increasing pressure from the Kyoto Protocol thenceforward, four aspects were further addressed for future research needs, including the quantification of SOC storage in the Second State Soil Survey and at present, the understanding of control mechanisms in both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic causes that determine SOC dynamics, the investigation of options that can effectively enhance SOC sequestration and/or reduce SOC loss, and the assessments of potentials and the likely SOC dynamics in the future on a national scale.","2006-08","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:28","2006-08-01","1785-1803","","15","51","","Chin.

However, during the second year, plastic film (20 mu m) with partial tillage of hairy vetch alone increased rice yield and decreased weed occurence; but barley and hairy vetch mixture showed opposite trends. Plastic film mulching led to a decrease in soil redox potential, mainly due to the decomposition of soil organic matter.

The present study evaluated the community structure and diversity of FLN in a field setting. The experiments were conducted in on-farm and on-station field plots sown to maize (Zea mays) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) under four cropping practices. These farming systems included organic (compost and biopesticide use), conventional (synthetic fertilizer and pesticide applications), farmer practice (organic and synthetic amendments) and a control (non-amended plots). Nineteen genera of free living nematodes, belonging to bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores and predators were recorded. Among these, bacterivores (Cephalobidae and Rhabditidae) were the most dominant group in the organic systems when compared to the conventional and control systems. Farming systems influenced the abundance and diversity of free living nematodes, with the organic farming system having higher values of maturity, enrichment and structural indices than other farming systems. This would indicate greater stability in soil health and improved soil fertility. This implies that the organic farming systems play a key role in improving the biodiversity and population buildup of FLN, compared with other systems. Our study helps to improve our understanding of how farming systems influence soil biodynamics, while studies on the longer-term effects of organic and conventional farming systems on the build-up or reduction of free living nematodes for improved ecosystem services are needed.","2022-04-01","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:58:37","2022-05-20","","","","327","","Agric.

Aims This study examined the fate of urea in combination with OA in the form of raw mill mud, composted mill mud and high N compost in a maize field experiment on a sandy loam soil in a rain-fed subtropical environment. Methods OAs (346 kg N ha(-1)) were incorporated at sowing with N-15 labelled urea (200 kg N ha(-1)) applied 28 days later, including a no OA control. Key results Grain yield, aboveground biomass and roots were not significantly different across all treatments, averaging 8.1, 17.4 and 1.3 t ha(-1) at harvest. Total N uptake was 249.1 kg N ha(-1) (on average) with fertiliser, native soil N and OAs sources accounting for 49.5, 44 and 6.5% of the total N uptake respectively. There was no significant difference in N fertiliser recovery between the OA treatments and the unamended control, with 61.7 and 3.7% of the applied N recovered in the plant and soil (to 100 cm), respectively, at harvest. Nitrogen fertiliser losses were equivalent to 33.6% of the applied N and were attributed to N leaching after extensive rainfall events late in the growing season. Conclusions OAs with high mineral and/or organic N content at time of application can supply significant amounts of plant available N but high levels of soil mineral N at sowing may hinder their full potential. Implications Reducing N loss and cost, and improving overall soil fertility by replacing synthetic N fertilisers with OAs may contribute to more environmentally sustainable crop production.","2022","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:58:34","2021-11-14","252-261","","3","60","","Soil Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000715241100001","","","2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this potential of NIs needs to be quantified across diverse field conditions to comprehensively assess the influence of management practices, crop types, fertilisation strategies, climatic conditions, annual variations, and soil types. In 2020, a field experiment was conducted using spring barley, followed by a similar experiment with winter wheat in 2021, aimed at studying N2O mitigation, crop nitrogen uptake and crop yield effects of three additives containing commercially available NIs: 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), nitrapyrin (NP), and a mixture of 1,2,4-triazole and 3-metylpyrazole (TM) together with synthetic (ammonium sulphate nitrate (NS), urea ammonium nitrate (UAN)) and organic (pig slurry (PS)) fertilisers. DMPP was applied with NS and PS, while NP and TM were applied with UAN and PS. Fertilisers were applied during early spring in both years, following the recommended optimal rate of synthetic fertiliser and PS. Control treatments included fertilisers applied at the same rate without NIs and no fertiliser. N2O fluxes were assessed throughout the growing seasons of both years utilising manual static flux chambers. The study found that N2O emissions were significantly reduced from PS with DMPP (by 77 %) and TM (by 67 %), and that DMPP significantly reduced N2O emissions from NS (by 60 %) in 2021. Crop yield and N uptake were increased with NIs in both years. These findings suggest that DMPP and TM effectively reduce N2O emissions from both PS and synthetic N sources. Notably, the mitigation effects were more pronounced in PS compared to synthetic N. Nonetheless, the efficiency of N2O reduction through these nitrification inhibitors varied depending on crop type and specific management conditions.","2025-02","2025-08-27 10:53:08","2025-08-27 10:56:21","2025-02-12","","","","37","","Environ.

Objective or Research Question The aims of this study were to: (i) quantify yield responses of wheat, maize, and rice to K addition, (ii) reveal changes in crop yield and soil physical-chemical-microbiological properties along soil available K (SAK) gradients, and (iii) identify dominant drivers mediating crop production. Methods We collected 13,190 observations from 1681 peer-reviewed articles that involved thirty-three Chinese long-term experiments with no fertilizer (NF), nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers (NP), and NP plus K fertilizers (NPK) treatments. Results Compared with NP, NPK significantly increased wheat, maize, and rice yield by 0.55 t ha(-1), 0.69 t ha(-1), and 0.54 t ha(-1), respectively. Notably, the yield ratios of NPK to NP decreased with SAK increase, and the thresholds of SAK calculated at an NPK/NP ratio equal to one were 159 mg kg(-1) for wheat, 149 mg kg(-1) for maize, and 94 mg kg(-1) for rice, respectively. Regression analysis revealed K-induced yield reductions in the twenty-first trial year across wheat, maize, and rice production systems in K-rich soils. Compared with NP, NPK significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, total K, available N, SAK, bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes when all data were pooled, but opposite trends were observed for SOC, invertase, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, fungi, and actinomycetes in sites of Northwest China with high SAK of > 170 mg kg(-1). Response ratios of NPK to NP for most soil microbiological properties significantly decreased along SAK gradients, indicating detrimental effects of K addition on soil microbial fertility in K-rich soils. According to Mantel's test and partial least squares path modeling analysis, SAK significantly positively affected crop yield in wheat and maize, whereas microbial variables negatively affected crop yield. By contrast, in rice, soil N and P rather than SAK, microbial variables, and enzymes were key determinants strongly regulating grain yield. Conclusions Potassium-induced benefits on crop yield and soil fertility are dependent on availability of soil indigenous K supply across wheat, maize, and rice production systems. To optimize K fertilization management, K fertilization should be prioritized for wheat and maize but not for rice.

To optimize nitrogen (N) balance and maize yield through integrated pig slurry and straw mulching management, a split-plot field experiment was conducted in Northeast China. The study included two straw treatments (straw mulching, S; no straw, NS) and three substitution levels of pig slurry for chemical fertilizer (0%, 20%, and 40%; denoted as M0, M20, and M40). Parameters evaluated included N balance, maize biomass, soil available N, and the mineral N to TN ratio (mineral-N/TN), measured across 0-100 cm at key maize growth stages. Results showed that pig slurry substitution significantly increased soil DON, mineral N, and mineral-N/TN in the topsoil (0-20 cm) at the maize seeding stage and decreased mineral-N/TN at the maize milk (10-40 cm) and maturity (80-100 cm) stages. Meanwhile, straw mulching reduced NH4+-N accumulation in the 0-10 cm of topsoil at the seeding stage, decreased NO3--N in the 0-40 cm soil layer from the jointing to maturity stages, and lowered the mineral-N/TN ratio in the topsoil, thereby mitigating the risk of N leaching. Notably, the combination of pig slurry substitution and straw mulching slightly increased DON and NO3--N in the topsoil while significantly reducing the mineral-N/TN in the deep soil layer at the seeding and milk stages. Pig slurry substitution significantly improved maize yield, N uptake, and N use efficiency (NUE). The highest maize yield (14,628 kg ha-1) was observed in the S-M20 treatment, representing a 19% increase compared to NS-M0. N balance analysis indicated that pig slurry substitution alone increased maize yield and N uptake but depleted soil N, whereas straw mulching maintained N surplus. The findings highlight that combining pig slurry with straw mulching optimizes soil N availability and improves sustainable N management and crop productivity in agroecosystems.","2025-04-27","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:56:54","2025-05-30","","","5","15","","Agron.-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001495828000001","","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, natural soil acidification due to bicarbonate (HCO3) leaching and base cation (BC) removal by crop harvest also affect soil acidity whereas the input of HCO3 and BC via fertilizers and manure counteract soil acidification. Insights in rates and drivers of soil acidification in different land use types is too limited to support crop- and site -specific mitigation strategies. In this study, we assessed the historical changes in cropland acidification rates and their drivers for the period 1985-2019 at 151 sites in a typical Chinese county with the combined nutrient and soil acidification model VSD+. VSD+ could well reproduce long-term changes in pH and in the BC concentrations of calcium, magnesium and potassium between 1985 and 2019 in non -calcareous soils. In paddy soils, the acidity production rate decreased from 1985 onwards, mainly driven by a pH -induced reduction in HCO3 leaching and N transformations. In upland soils, however, acidity production was mainly driven by N transformations and hardly changed over time. Crop BC removal by harvesting played a minor role in both paddy and upland soils, but its relative importance increased in paddy soils. The acidity input was partly neutralized by HCO3 input from fertilizers and manure, which decreased over time due to a change from ammonia bicarbonate to urea. Soil buffering by both BC and aluminium release decreased in paddy soils due to a reduction in net acidity production, while it stayed relatively constant in upland soils. We conclude that acidification management in paddy soils requires a focus on avoiding high HCO3 leaching whereas the management in upland soils should focus on balancing N with recycling organic manure and crop residues.","2024-03-15","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:48","2024-03-13","","","","916","","Sci.

Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) stabilizes soil ag-gregates and enhances soil carbon and nitrogen storage in agricultural ecosystems. However, the underlying mechanisms and relative importance of GRSP on N2O fluxes within soil aggregate fraction remain largely unclear. We examined the GRSP content, denitrifying bacterial community composition, and potential N2O fluxes across three aggregate-size fractions (2000-250 mu m, 250-53 mu m, and <53 mu m) under a long-term fertilization agricultural ecosystem, subjected to mineral fertilizer or manure and their combination. Our findings indicated that various fertil-ization treatments have no discernible impact on the size distribution of soil aggregates, paving the way to further re-search into the impact of soil aggregates on GRSP content, the denitrifying bacterial community composition, and potential N2O fluxes. GRSP content increased with the increase in soil aggregate size. Potential N2O fluxes (including gross N2O production and N2O reduction and net N2O production) among aggregates were highest in microaggregates (250-53 mu m), followed by macroaggregates (2000-250 mu m) and lowest in silt + clay (<53 mu m) fractions. Potential N2O fluxes had a positive response to soil aggregate GRSP fractions. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that soil aggregate size could drive the denitrifying functional microbial community composition, and deter-ministic processes play more critical roles than stochasticity processes in driving denitrifying functional composition under soil aggregate fractions. Procrustes analysis revealed a significant correlation between denitrifying microbial community, soil aggregate GRSP fractions, and potential N2O fluxes. Our study suggests that soil aggregate GRSP fractions influence potential nitrous oxide fluxes by affecting denitrifying microbial functional composition within soil aggregate.","2023-07-01","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:58:16","2023-05-22","","","","880","","Sci.

Clarifying its continuous benefits considering the soil response and feedback is crucial for sustainable agricultural development. An 8-year field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of successive fertilizer optimization with slow-release fertilizer (70% substitute, SRF) and organic fertilizer (partial (20%) substitute, OFPS; full (100%) substitute, OFFS) on nitrogen (N) fate in paddies with conventional split fertilization (CF) and no N-fertilizer input (N0) as the controls. Soil properties, as well as bacterial communities, were also analyzed. An overall increase occurred in plant N uptake in fertilized plots compared with that in the N0 control. The N use efficiency (NUE) of the CF treatment was identical to those of the SRF and OFPS treatments (39.14-43.90%), while OFFS treatment showed a lower value. Besides, optimized fertilization decreased NH3 volatilization and N leaching by 29.54-51.09% and 12.24-51.62%, respectively, particularly in the OFFS treatment. Unlike the reduction in organic inputs, N runoff in the SRF treatment was the highest in the 7th year and the lowest in the 8th year. Additionally, N2O emissions were insignificant among the different treatments. Paddy-water N concentration was the key factor affecting the fate of N, although soil properties also governed the N2O emissions and N runoff. Apparently, the soil bacterial community responded to the optimized fertilization, although their response varied with different strategies. Our findings revealed the efficacy of successive optimized fertilization on N fate, which can provide a basis for the sustainable fertilization of paddies.","2023-12","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:58:15","2023-09-22","6088-6100","","4","23","","J.

Multiple cropping of green manure after wheat harvest is a typical planting pattern in the Hetao Irrigation District, and maybe substitute nitrogen (N) fertilizer. However, information is scarce about how the green manure affected SMF and crop production under limited nitrogen inputs. A 7-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of green manure types (Feed rape (FR), Vicia villosa (VV), Feed rape, and Vicia villosa mixed sowing (FR + VV)) on soil properties, enzyme activities, SMF, and rotated wheat yield under different N application rates (150 kg N ha-1, N150; no nitrogen, N0). The results showed that FR and FR + VV increased soil active carbon (C) and N fractions by 4.0 %-499.3 % and 11.3 %-147.8 % compared to VV, respectively. Enzyme activities with FR + VV were significantly increased by 13.7 %-82.9 % compared to FR and VV. SMF and CCI (carbon cycling index) were significantly affected by N fertilizer and green manure types, with N0 higher than N150 by two times and FR + VV higher than FR by 1.4-4.3 times and VV by 1.0-6.6 times in 0-20 cm soil layer. Spring wheat yield was significantly affected by N fertilizer and green manure types, with N0 significantly higher than N150 by 5.8 % and FR and FR + VV higher than VV by 8.0 % and 12.5 % under N150, respectively. Partial least squares path model detected that returning of multiple green manure had a significant positive and indirect effect on SMF through enhancing soil enzyme activities, and ultimately contribute to the improvement in wheat yield. In conclusion, the mixed sowing of FR and VV increased soil active C and N fractions and associated enzyme activities, and has the potential to improve the SMF and rotated wheat yield, thereby providing an effective approach to reduce N fertilizer.","2024-02","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:46","2023-12-16","","","","235","","Catena","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001110306800001","","","12 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dynamic soil acidification model VSD+ was calibrated on measured pH changes in a long-term fertilization experiment (1990-2018), in which variable amounts of inorganic N, P and potassium (K), lime (L) and organic manure (M) were applied annually to a maize-wheat rotation on red soil. Adding NPK inorganic fertilizers only sharply decreased the soil pH by 1.5 units within 10 years. The pH remained relatively constant, however, in the experiment in which 70% of the N given by fertilizer was replaced by manure (NPKM) while lime addition after 20 years of NPK addition (NPKL) increased the pH by approximately 1.5 units. Historic soil pH changes were well reconstructed by VSD+ . The model quantified that nitrogen transformations contributed up to 89% of the total acidity production in the NPK treatment, which could be fully neutralized by replacing 70% of the total N fertilizer input with manure. Scenarios were assessed to explore the future impacts of adapted nutrient man-agement on soil acidification and nutrient surplus. Balancing the N and P input with crop demand (BNP) significantly reduces the N and P surplus but hardly affects the acidification rate compared to Business as Usual (BAU, equal to the NPK treatment). Balancing the N input and substituting N fertilizer with manure (BM) counteract acidification and maintain the optimal soil pH of 6.5 but strongly increase the annual P surplus. An optimized combination of fertilizer, manure and lime (OPT) was thus identified to minimize acidification and unnecessary P accumulation in soils, by balancing crop N, P and base cation (BC) demands and unavoidable N and BC leaching. We conclude that the VSD+ model can be used as a sustainable nutrient and acid management tool to derive optimal application rates of fertilizer, manure and lime in agricultural systems.","2023-03-01","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:58:10","2023-03-02","","","","292","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:000927289700001","","","15 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have investigated the effects of MV on phosphorus (P) availability and the risk of P loss. An 11-year field experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of returning MV to paddy soil on soil P forms, late rice yield and soil fertility, as well as the related mechanisms. The experiment included seven treatments: (1) F0M0 (no-fertilizer and no-MV); (2) F1M0 (chemical fertilizer alone), (3) F2M0 (70% of chemical fertilizer), and F2MV1-4 (70% of chemical fertilizer and 7500 kg ha-1 MV, 15000 kg ha-1 MV, 22500 kg ha-1 MV, 30000 kg ha-1 MV). The Olsen-P of F2M1-4 were significantly higher (38.3-54.5%) than that of F2M0 and the CaCl2-P levels of F2M1-4 were significantly lower (47.7-61.6%) than that of F1M0. The Olsen-P was mainly influenced by soil total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), pH, free Fe/Al (FeDCB/ AlDCB), organic bound Fe (Feo), noncrystalline amorphous Al (Alox) and exchange Mg2+, while the CaCl2-P was mainly influenced by TP, pH Alox, FeDCB, AlDCB, and exchange Mg2+/Ca2+. Partial least squares path model analysis indicated that chemical fertilizer played more important role on the Olsen-P and the CaCl2-P. MV application had the negative effect (the total effect value-0.48) on the CaCl2-P and decreased the risk of P loss yet. Two-segment regression analyses indicated the critical Olsen-P levels were 19.39 mg kg-1 for late rice yield and 31.94 mg kg-1 for soluble P, respectively. In conclusion, the continuous application of MV not only improved P availability to enhance late rice yield, but also reduced the risk of P loss in paddy soil in double rice systems.","2023-10-15","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:56:51","2023-08-28","","","","302","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001050115700001","","","18 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review","Agronomy for Sustainable Development","","1774-0746","10.1051/agro/2010034","","China is facing one of the largest challenges of this century to continue to increase annual cereal production to about 600 Mt by 2030 to ensure food security with shrinking cropland and limited resources, while maintaining or improving soil fertility, and protecting the environment. Rich experiences in integrated and efficient utilization of different strategies of crop rotation, intercropping, and all possible nutrient resources accumulated by Chinese farmers in traditional farming systems have been gradually abandoned and nutrient management shifted to over-reliance on synthetic fertilizers. China is now the world's largest producer, consumer and importer of chemical fertilizers. Overapplication of nitrogen (N) is common in intensive agricultural regions, and current N-uptake efficiency was reported to be only 28.3, 28.2 and 26.1% for rice, wheat and maize, respectively, and less than 20% in intensive agricultural regions and for fruit trees or vegetable crops. In addition to surface and groundwater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, over-application of N fertilizers has caused significant soil acidification in major Chinese croplands, decreasing soil pH by 0.13 to 2.20. High yield as a top priority, small-scale farming, lack of temporal synchronization of nutrient supply and crop demand, lack of effective extension systems, and hand application of fertilizers by farmers are possible reasons leading to the over-application problems. There is little doubt that current nutrient management practices are not sustainable and more efficient management systems need to be developed. A review of long-term experiments conducted around the world indicated that chemical fertilizer alone is not enough to improve or maintain soil fertility at high levels and the soil acidification problem caused by overapplication of synthetic N fertilizers can be reduced if more fertilizer N is applied as NO (3) (-) relative to ammonium- or urea-based N fertilizers. Organic fertilizers can improve soil fertility and quality, but long-term application at high rates can also lead to more nitrate leaching, and accumulation of P, if not managed well. Well-managed combination of chemical and organic fertilizers can overcome the disadvantages of applying single source of fertilizers and sustainably achieve higher crop yields, improve soil fertility, alleviate soil acidification problems, and increase nutrient-use efficiency compared with only using chemical fertilizers. Crop yield can be increased through temporal diversity using crop rotation strategies compared with continuous cropping and legume-based cropping systems can reduce carbon and nitrogen losses. Crop yield responses to N fertilization can vary significantly from year to year due to variation in weather conditions and indigenous N supply, thus the commonly adopted prescriptive approach to N management needs to be replaced by a responsive in-season management approach based on diagnosis of crop growth, N status and demand. A crop sensor-based in-season site-specific N management strategy was able to increase Nuptake efficiency by 368% over farmers' practices in the North China Plain.Combination of these well-tested nutrient management principles and practices with modern crop management technologies is needed to develop sustainable nutrient management systems in China that can precisely match field-to-field and year-to-year variability in nutrient supply and crop demand for both single crops and crop rotations to not only improve nutrient-use efficiency but also increase crop yieldand protect the environment. In addition, innovative and effective extension and service-providing systems to assist farmers in adopting and applying new management systems and technologies are also crucially important for China to meet the grand challenge of food security, nutrient-use efficiency and sustainable development.","2011-04","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:59:59","2011-04-01","397-414","","2","31","","Agron.

Improving N use efficiency in crops is essential for increasing agricultural productivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of intercropping maize with leguminous green manure on grain yield and N utilization under reduced N-fertilization conditions. A field experiment with a split-plot design was conducted in northwestern China from 2018 to 2021. The main plots consisted of two cropping systems: maize-common vetch intercropping (IM) and sole maize (SM). The subplots had three N levels: zero N application (N0, 0 kg ha-1), a 25% reduction from the traditional chemical N supply (N1, 270 kg ha-1), and the traditional chemical N supply (N2, 360 kg ha-1). The results showed that the negative effects of N reduction on maize grain yield and N uptake were compensated by intercropping leguminous green manure, and the improvements increased with cultivation years. The integrated system involving maize-leguminous green manure intercropping and a reduced N supply enhanced N translocation from maize vegetative organs to grains and increased the nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase activities in maize leaves. The supercompensatory effect in maize leaves increased year by year, reaching values of 16.1, 21.3, and 25.5% in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. These findings suggest that intercropping maize with leguminous green manure under reduced chemical N input can enhance N assimilation and uptake in maize. By using this strategy, chemical fertilizer is effectively replaced by leguminous green manure, thereby improving N use efficiency and maintaining stable yields in the maize-based intercropping system.","2025-07","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:38","2025-06-28","2826-2840","","7","24","","J.

Furthermore, imbalanced and inappropriate use of inorganic nutrients worsened the soil resource base by reducing the population of beneficial micro-organisms and also deteriorated the quality of the crops. Increased health consciousness among the masses has augmented the demand for safe and quality foods for which a comprehensive food production technology needs to be developed with emphasises on quality enhancement and yield stability. In fact, it is not affordable for an average Indian farmer to jump immediately from inorganic source of nutrients to organics in their crop production as it may lead to unbearable drastic reduction in crop yields in the initial years. This may become possible through the progressive substitution of organic sources of nutrients in place of in organics to meet crop nutrient requirement for attaining higher and stable crop yield of better quality with an improvement in soil health. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of differential substitution of nutrients through organics on growth, yield, quality, nutrient uptake and economics of green gram in Shiwalik foothill region.Methods: In this field experiment conducted during summer 2016 and 2017, at SKUAST-Jammu, Main Campus Chatha with green gram variety SML-668 on sandy clay loam soil. The experiment was laid out in randomized block design with sixteen treatments during both the years using recommended package and practices.Result: The result of the study concluded that RDF and 75% NPK +25% N through Vermicompost and FYM (1:1) were adjudged as the best treatments with regard to crop growth parameters, yield and yield attributes, net returns and benefit cost ratio where as highest crop quality traits were realized where in 100% N was substituted through FYM followed by Vermicompost and Vermicompost and FYM (1:1). Treatment 100% N was substituted through FYM was adjudged as the best treatment in improving crop quality traits and soil properties.

As a consequence, to maintain high levels of both crop productivity and soil organic matter and to improve some soil properties, a reduction of agricultural inputs and a greater supply of organic material are needed. In the light of these considerations, we carried out a two-year field experiment in Southern Italy to determine the effects of reduced soil tillage and municipal solid waste compost application on growth parameters, production and quality of sugar beet crops, and on both soil chemical characteristics and mineral nitrogen deficit. Two soil tillage depths were compared: conventional tillage, till 40-45 cm and shallow tillage, at 15-20 cm. Within each soil tillage, the following N-fertilising strategies were tested: (1) mineral fertilisation, with 100 kg N ha(-1); (2) organic fertilisation with municipal solid waste compost at 100 kg N ha(-1); (3) mixed fertilisation, with 50% of organic N as municipal solid waste compost, and 50% of mineral N; and (4) slow-release organic-mineral N fertiliser, at 100 kg N ha(-1). All these treatments were compared with a lower level of mineral fertiliser at 50 kg N ha(-1), and with an unfertilised control. Our findings show first the absence of a significant difference in root and sucrose yields between reduced tillage and deep tillage; as shown by roots (36.02 t ha(-1)) and sucrose (3.41 t ha(-1)) yields for reduced tillage and 35.76 and 3.51 t ha(-1), respectively, for the deepest tillage. Secondly, among the N treatments, the mixed organic-mineral N fertilisation gave productions statistically not diffierent from mineral N fertilisation; as shown by root yields (36.38 versus 36.40 tha(-1)) and sucrose yields ( 3.56 versus 3.65 t ha(-1)). Third, the mixed organic-mineral N induced a reduction of 13.2% in a-amino N content by comparison with the mineral treatment of 100 kg N ha-1. Fourth, our results showed that the applications of the municipal solid waste compost increased the extracted and the humified organic carbon by +27.7 and +25.4%, compared with the mineral fertiliser, and did not raise the content of heavy metals. These findings highlighted that in Southern Italy it is sustainable to adopt alternative sugar beet production, safeguarding crops' quantitative and qualitative performance, decreasing the production costs and using the natural resources better.","2007-06","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:56:19","2007-04-01","129-137","","2","27","","Agron.

However, studies examining the effects of straw return combined with reduced nitrogen fertilization on soil quality are still insufficient to meet the precise fertilization needs, necessitating further research. This study employed two treatments: rapeseed straw plus sorghum straw (LT) and rapeseed green manure plus sorghum straw (YGT) returned to the soil. Nitrogen was applied at three rates: 0%, 70% of the conventional amount (0.7CK) and the conventional fertilization (CK). Meanwhile, conventional fertilization was used as a control. Over three consecutive years, this experiment investigated the impact of these treatments on sorghum yield and soil nutrient properties, evaluating overall soil quality and individual soil fertility components. Straw return significantly improved soil quality, with enhancements ranging from 6.5 to 61.4% compared to the CK. The LT + 0.7CK and YGT + 0.7CK produced relatively higher yields, increasing by 10.9% and 10.49% respectively over the CK. Moreover, the comprehensive soil quality of these two treatments is also relatively high, and the comprehensive soil quality of both is at the same level. However, the absence of rapeseed yield in the YGT + 0.7CK treatment during the rapeseed season suggests that LT + 0.7CK is a more economically viable fertilization approach. Soil fertility evaluations indicated that the LT + 0.7CK treatment did not meet the third-level farmland nutrient standards for available potassium, organic matter, total phosphorus, and total potassium. Future fertilization strategies should continue incorporating organic fertilizers and further research to enhance soil phosphorus and potassium contents, thus improving fertilization schemes. This study provides valuable insights for the sustainable utilization of straw resources and the reduction of chemical fertilizers in the Yangtze River Basin.","2025-02-26","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:56:47","2025-03-08","","","1","15","","Sci.

Few studies have used archived samples, long-term resampling of soils to a depth of I m, and space for time studies to document these changes. We resampled soils by depth (0-100 cm) in fields at 19 locations in central Illinois on poorly drained Mollisols that were in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) rotations, were tile drained, and had no known history of manure application in recent decades. Three fields were paired with virgin prairie remnants, two had grass borders that were sampled, and 16 had been previously sampled in 1901 to 1904 or 1957 under various land uses (virgin prairie, cultivation, grass cover). The soils had large amounts of C and N in the profile, with mean values of 179 Mg C ha(-1) and 16.1 Mg N ha(-1) for the 18 cultivated fields sampled in 2001 and 2002. We confirmed a large reduction in organic C and total N pools from conversion of prairies to annual cultivation and artificial drainage and documented no change in these organic matter pools of cultivated soils during the period of synthetic fertilizer use (1957-2002). Cultivated fields had soil C and N concentrations typically 30 to 50% less than virgin prairie soils. Smaller but significant declines in C and N concentrations were found when comparing 1900s cultivated fields to concentrations in 2002, after another 100 yr of cultivation, and in comparing 1957 grass covered fields that had been converted to annual cultivation before 2002. The reduction in organic matter after cultivation of prairies occurred mostly in the cop 50 cm of soil, with evidence of translocation of C and N from these upper layers to the 50- to 100-cm depth, possibly enhanced by tile drainage. For these Mollisols, declines in organic matter were likely completed by the 1950s, with organic matter pools in a steady state under the production practices in place from the late 1950s through 2002.","2009-02","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 11:00:03","2009-01-01","200-211","","1","38","","J.

Ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are harmful N pollutants that may contribute both directly and indirectly to global warming. Surface applied manure, urea and ammonium (NH4+) based fertilizers are important anthropogenic sources of these emissions. Nitrification inhibitors (NIs) have been proposed as a useful technological approach to reduce N2O emission although they can lead to large NH3 losses due to increasing NH4 pool in soils. In this context, a field experiment was carried out in a maize field with aiming to simultaneously quantify NH3 volatilization and N2O emission, assessing the effect of two NIs 3,4 dimethilpyrazol phosphate (DMPP) and 3,4 dimethylpyrazole succinic acid (DMPSA). The first treatment was pig slurry (PS) before seeding (50 kg N ha 1)and calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) a top-dressing (150 kg N ha(-1)), and the second was DMPP diluted in PS (PS + DMPP) (50 kg N ha(-1))and CAN + DMPSA (150 kg N ha(-1))also before seeding and at top-dressing, respectively. Ammonia emissions were quantified by a micrometeorological method during 20 days after fertilization and N2O emissions were assessed using manual static chambers during all crop period. The treatment with NIs was effective in reducing c. 30% cumulative N2O losses. However, considering only direct N2O emissions after second fertilization event, a significant reduction was not observed using CAN+DMPSA, probably because high WFPS of soil, driven by irrigation, favored denitrification. Cumulative NH3 losses were not significantly affected by NIs. Indeed, NH3 volatilization accounted 14% and 10% of N applied in PS + DMPP and PS plots, respectively and c. 2% of total N applied in CAN+DMPSA and CAN plots. Since important NH3 losses still exist even although abating strategies are implemented, structural and political initiatives are needed to face this issue. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The distribution of different fractions of soil nitrogen viz. exchangeable NH4 (+)-N, hydrolysable NH4 (+)-N, hexoseamine-N, amino acid-N, unidentified-N and status of total-N were determined. The significant increase in number of millable cane (NMC) and cane yield was recorded in the treatments receiving bio-compost in combination with fertilizer-N over control both in plant and ratoon crops. The highest number of NMC (90.7 x 10(3)/ha), cane yield (74.14 t/ha) and sugar yield (7.72 t/ha) of plant was recorded in treatments receiving 50% N through bio-compost +50% N through inorganic fertilizer. The residual effect of treatment receiving 50% N through bio-compost and 50% N through inorganic fertilizer was also pronounced on NMC (83.90 x 10(3)/ha), yield (69.70 t/ha) and sugar yield (7.42 t/ha). Further, application of 100, 125 and 150% N through bio-compost resulted in gradual decrease in yield of plant, but on the contrary, it increased by 6-7% in ratoon crop as compared to plant cane. The uptake of nutrients varied significantly. The highest sugar yield (plant and ratoon) was recorded in treatment receiving 50% N through bio-compost +50% N through inorganic fertilizer. Addition of bio-compost either alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizer-N significantly improved organic carbon and availability of nutrients (N, P, K and S) with reduction in bulk density of post-harvest soil over control.

While organic substitution, green manure incorporation, and targeted fertilization sites have individually shown promise in enhancing rice yield, there is still a gap between optimized fertilization methods and achieving sustainable rice production. To explore the factors influencing rice yield across different fertilization strategies, we conducted a field experiment in Southern China encompassing five treatments, such as CK (no N input), RN (broadcasting urea with recommended N rates), RON (broadcasting organic-inorganic fertilizer with recommended N rates), RONS (side-deep placement of organic-inorganic fertilizer with recommended N rates), and RONSA (coupled RONS with Azolla [Azolla pinnata R. Brown]). Using a Minimum Data Set approach, we identified the primary variables influencing soil properties and rice production, with a focus on soil physicochemical characteristics and bacterial communities. Further, the soil properties index (SPI), calculated by multiplying the linear score with the weight of each variable, served as an indicator of soil properties variations. Our findings revealed that RONSA significantly increased the SPI by 21.1% compared with RN, predominantly because of higher soil labile organic carbon (LOC) and available N (SAN) fractions (p < .05). N uptake in rice plants (23.9%-28.4%) increased dramatically under RONSA leading to higher rice yield (11.0%-16.9%) and NUE (30.2%-36.1%) than RN (p < .05). The enhancement in soil properties, characterized by increased LOC, SAN fractions, and bacterial community diversity, was essential in boosting rice yields, with dissolved inorganic N emerging as the dominant contributor. In summary, our results highlight the effectiveness of integrated fertilization approaches in enhancing soil properties, subsequently leading to improved rice yields and NUE. This fertilizer strategy holds promise for guiding field fertilization practices and advancing sustainable rice production.","2024-04","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:44","2024-06-18","","","2","40","","Soil Use Manage.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001239070100001","","","3 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this practice causes serious soil depletion and N loss in the traditional wheat cropping system in the Loess Plateau of China. Growing summer legumes as the green manure (GM) crop is a viable solution because of its unique ability to fix atmospheric N-2. Actually, little is known about the contribution of GM N to grain and N utilization in the subsequent crop. Therefore, we conducted a four-year field experiment with four winter wheat-based rotations (summer fallow-wheat, Huai bean-wheat, soybean-wheat, and mung bean-wheat) and four nitrogen fertilizer rates applied to wheat (0, 108, 135, and 162 kg N/ha) to investigate the fate of GM nitrogen via decomposition, utilization by wheat, and contribution to grain production and nitrogen economy through GM legumes. Here we showed that GM legumes accumulated 53-76 kg N/ha per year. After decomposing for approximately one year, more than 32 kg N/ha was released from GM legumes. The amount of nitrogen released via GM decomposition that was subsequently utilized by wheat was 7-27 kg N/ha. Incorporation of GM legumes effectively replaced 13-48% (average 31%) of the applied mineral nitrogen fertilizer. Additionally, the GM approach during the fallow period reduced the risk of nitrate-N leaching to depths of 0-100 cm and 100-200 cm by 4.8 and 19.6 kg N/ha, respectively. The soil nitrogen pool was effectively improved by incorporation of GM legumes at the times of wheat sowing. Cultivation of leguminous GM during summer is a better option than bare fallow to maintain the soil nitrogen pool, and decrease the rates required for N fertilization not only in the Loess Plateau of China but also in other similar dryland regions worldwide.

Despite the pivotal role of Ncycling microbes in agro-ecosystems, little is known about the importance of rare microbes to N cycles in acidic soils under manure fertilization. Here, we conducted a 11 -year field experiment in which chemical N fertilizers were substituted with swine manure at different doses in an acidic soil. We investigated soil biological N fixation (BNF), potential nitrification rate (PNR), denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), and associated microbial communities (diazotrophs, ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA), and nirK- and nirS-type denitrifiers). With the increase of manure dose, BNF, PNR, DEA and abundances of soil N-cycling functional genes significantly increased. Manure application changed whole and subgroup (abundant, intermediate, and rare taxa) community structures of these N-cycling microbes and increased Shannon indexes of AOA, AOB and nirK-type denitrifiers but not diazotrophs and nirS-type denitrifiers. The community structures and Shannon variations of rare AOA and AOB subgroups highly contributed to PNR and subgroup community structures of rare nirK- and nirS-type denitrifiers were significantly related to DEA, but rare diazotrophs did not contribute to BNF. In the co-occurrence networks of AOA, AOB, nirK- and nirS-type denitrifiers, most keystone species were rare taxa, and the positive edge numbers belonging to rare taxa were positively related to PNR and DEA. Manure-derived microbial species provided the very low contributions to community dissimilarities of these soil N-cycling microbes. Our findings suggested that rare microbes made surprisingly important contributions to soil nitrification and denitrification rather than N-fixation in manured acidic soils.","2024-04","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:56:35","2024-03-13","","","","196","","Appl.

A mode of integrated maize silage planting and dairy breeding system (IPBS) has been widely promoted in China, as a promising way to recycle manure, reduce chemical fertilizer consumption and improve soil quality. However, quantitative environmental impacts and mitigation potential of this system remains unclear. In this study, based on life cycle assessment (LCA), environmental performance of non-IPBS and IPBS were compared: nonIPBS only involved dairy cow breeding, whereas maize silage planting was incorporated in IPBS. Results indicated that, although 60% of the surveyed dairy farms adopted IPBS, the self-sufficiency rate of maize silage was 57%. Compared with non-IPBS, IPBS had apparent potential in reducing global warming potential (-14%), acidification potential (-10%), eutrophication potential (-18%), non-renewable energy use (-10%), water use (-8%) and land use (-13%). It is estimated that, in China, 81% of dairy farms could adopt IPBS, resulting in a reduction of approximately 21% in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to compared with current situation, but the premise is that 2.0 million ha cropland should be applied for maize silage cultivation. Interestingly, environmental performance of IPBS was affected by the self-sufficiency rate of maize silage and restricted by milk yield and maize silage yield. Thus, mitigation of environmental impacts of milk production could be realized by combining a short-term strategy of increasing maize silage planting area in dairy farms and a long-term plan for technological improvements in the yield of crop and milk.","2021-08-01","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:58:56","2021-07-02","","","","309","","J.

Sweetpotato and wheat rotation has emerged as an important rotation system and an effective strategy to optimize nutrient cycling and enhance soil fertility in hilly areas, which is also a good option to improve soil acidification and raise soil quality. Studying the effects of different fertilization regimes on soil acidification provides crucial data for managing it effectively. An eight-year field experiment explored seven fertilizer treatments: without fertilization (CK), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilization (PK), nitrogen (N) and K fertilization (NK), NP fertilization (NP), NP with K chloride fertilization (NPK1), NP with K sulfate fertilization (NPK2), and NPK combined with organic fertilization (NPKM). This study focused on the soil acidity, buffering capacity, and related indicators. After eight years of continuous fertilization in the sweetpotato-wheat rotation, all the treatments accelerated the soil acidification. Notably, N fertilization reduced the soil pH by 1.30-1.84, whereas N-deficient soil showed minimal change. Organic fertilizer addition resulted in the slowest pH reduction among the N treatments. Both N-deficient (PK) and organic fertilizer addition (NPKM) significantly increased the soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) by 8.83% and 6.55%, respectively, compared to CK. Similar trends were observed for the soil-buffering capacity (pHBC). NPK2 increased the soil K+ content more effectively than NPK1. NPKM reduced the sodium and magnesium content compared to CK, with the highest magnesium content among the treatments at 1.60 cmol<middle dot>kg-1. Regression tree analysis identified the N input and soil magnesium and calcium content as the primary factors influencing the pHBC changes. Structural equation modeling showed that the soil pH is mainly influenced by the soil ammonium N content and pHBC, with coefficients of -0.28 and 0.29, respectively. Changes in the soil pH in the sweetpotato-wheat rotation were primarily associated with the pHBC and N input, where the CEC content emerged as the main factor, modulated by magnesium and calcium. Long-term organic fertilization enhances the soil pHBC and CEC, slowing the magnesium reduction and mitigating soil acidification in agricultural settings.","2024-07","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:45","2024-07-22","","","13","13","","Plants-basel","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001269158200001","","","4 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of integrated application of February Orchid as green manure with reduction of chemical fertilizers (INTEGRATED) on spring maize yield, N uptake, ammonium volatilization, and soil residual mineral N in northern China. Compared to farmers' traditional fertilization (CON), integrated application of February Orchid as green manure with 30% reduction of nitrogen fertilizers (INTEGRATED) increased maize grain yield and biomass by 9.9 and 10.2%, respectively.

Rethinking the future agricultural production to simultaneously safeguard resources security and regulate environmental pollution is essential. Circular agriculture opens up a new path for the high-efficiency and environmental-friendly production. An integrated energy-water-food nexus optimization approach for managing agricultural resources and wastes in line with the principles of sustainable circular agriculture management is lacking. Objective: This study therefore proposes an integrated uncertain optimization model to manage agricultural croplivestock-biogas-crop recycling systems from a cross-sectoral energy-water-food nexus perspective in the changing environment. The aims are to: (1) balance objectives of input reduction, output promotion, ensuring equity, and global warming mitigation; (2) generate sustainable resources allocation strategies based on efficiency and recycling; (3) assess the global warming mitigation potential of the recycling systems from a life cycle perspective; and (4) deal with interactions, complexities, uncertainties, and risks existed in the recycling systems. Methods: The proposed model framework is based on a stochastic multi-objective programming, while triangular fuzzy numbers, fuzzy credibility constrained programming, Stewart model, analytic hierarchy process, andopportunity carbon footprint are integrated to enhance its practicability and feasibility. The model is verified through a real-world case study in the Zhanghe Irrigation District, Hubei province, China. Results and conclusions: Results show that optimal water and land resources allocation solutions are more efficient than current strategies, with water consumption per unit area decreasing by 13.63% and rice production per unit area improving by 22.06%. Paddy field and biogas leakage are two of the largest sources of GHG emission, calling for agronomic and engineering measures to improve farmland management and biogas generation technology. Livestock breeding contributes 10% of the total GHG emission, along with generating 76% of the total biogas, indicating the great significance of manure recycle. Overall, 4.26 x 108 kg CO2 is reduced in the recycling system, contributed by chemical fertilizer reduction, agricultural wastes recycle, and non-renewable energy replacement. Significance: The study offers a potential nexus optimization approach for sustainable management of agricultural recycling systems from a holistic perspective. It can be used as a general model to extend to other agricultural systems suffering from similar resources and environmental crisis.","2022-02","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:58:30","2022-05-19","","","","196","","Agric.

Organic manure and straw mulching are well-known for mitigating soil erosion. However, the mechanisms by which these organic materials enhance soil multifunctionality during the restoration of erosiondegraded soil remain unclear. To address this, soil multifunctionality in eroded soil was investigated after a decade of continuous organic material application. Four treatments were established: 1) a control group applied only chemical fertilizer (CK); 2) organic manure with 20 % nitrogen substituted (OM); 3) straw mulching with 20 % nitrogen substituted (SW); and 4) a combination of organic manure and straw mulching (1:1) with 20 % nitrogen substituted (OMSW). The findings showed that organic manure, straw mulching, and the combination treatments reduced runoff by 2.12-45.97 % and sediment by 33.54-109.33 %, reduced nutrient loss and increased soil nutrient and water-stable aggregates (WSA) contents, especially in the straw mulching and the combination treatments. The improved soil environment enhanced microbial community stability, increased the microbial functional Shannon index, and enriched carbon (e.g., bcrB/C/D) and nitrogen (e.g., amoB/C, napA, and nirB) cycling genes, thus improving soil multifunctionality. Specifically, organic manure increased soil multifunctionality by 87.88 %, straw mulching by 457.40 %, and their combination by 154.73 %. Soil erosion environment and microbial functions, especially carbon and nitrogen cycling, were key factors influencing soil multifunctionality. Notably, key microbial taxa such as Proteobacteria play pivotal roles in stabilizing community structure and maintaining community function during soil restoration. This study underscores that organic manure application and straw mulching, mainly through reducing soil erosion, improved soil environment, optimized the composition and function of soil microbial communities, and ultimately enhanced soil multifunctionality. This is pivotal for safeguarding the ecological integrity of sloping farmland and fostering sustainable agricultural development.","2025-05-01","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:56:59","2025-02-20","","","","383","","Agric.

We studied the response of nitrate in spring water to a reduction of nitrogen fertilizer applications in agriculture realized since the mid-1980s. We assessed the travel time distribution of groundwater based on a time series of tritium measurements for 90 springs and small brooks that drain a dual porosity chalk aquifer. The travel time distributions were constrained using the tritium data in combination with time series of nitrate concentrations, applying a shape-free travel time distribution model. A clear trend reversal of nitrate concentrations was observed and simulated for springs with a large fraction of young water (< 30 years old) whereas the nitrate response in springs with relatively older water was attenuated and delayed. We conclude that obtaining a time series of tritium data helps to constrain age distributions of water that is discharged from dual permeability aquifers. The fraction of water aged <30 years was a meaningful parameter to distinguish between different types of springs. Nitrate trends in springs that drain large fractions of young water (> 0.6) show higher peak concentrations, shorter lag-time between leaching and outflow peaks and steeper declines after trend reversal, relative to trends in springs which are dominantly fed by older groundwater. The study thus shows that the nitrate legacy of groundwater systems is strongly determined by the range of their travel time distributions, and trend reversal in receiving springs and surface waters may appear within 10 to 15 years after measures to reduce nitrate losses from farming.","2024-11-15","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:58","2024-09-10","","","","951","","Sci.

Abatement strategies are necessary in order to achieve NE3 emission targets by reducing those emissions. In this context, a field experiment was carried out on a sunflower crop in spring 2006 with the aim of evaluating the effect of the N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) in the mitigation of volatilized NH3 from a urea-fertilised soil. Ammonia emission was quantified, using the integrated horizontal flux (IHF) method, following application of urea with and without the urease inhibitor NBPT. Urea and a mixture of urea and NBPT (0.14%, w/w) were surface-applied at a rate of 170 kg N ha(-1) to circular plots (diameter 40 m). The soil was irrigated with 10 mm of water just after the application of urea to dissolve and incorporate it into the upper layer of soil. Over the duration of the measurement period (36 days) three peaks of NE3 were observed. The first peak was associated with hydrolysis of urea after irrigation and the others with the increase of ammonia in soil solution after changes in atmospheric variables such as wind speed and rainfall. The total NH3 emission during the whole experiment was 17.3 +/- 0.5 kg NH3-N ha(-1) in the case of urea treated soils and 10.0 +/- 2.2 kg NH3-N ha(-1) where NBPT was included with the urea (10.1 and 5.9%, respectively, of the applied urea-N). The lower NH3 emissions from plots fertilised with urea + NBPT, compared with urea alone, were associated with a reduction in urease activity during the first 9 days after inhibitor application.

To sustain soil fertility and productivity in continuous cropping system, various fertilization strategies have been explored. However, the relationship between fertilization and soil microbial communities, particularly concerning soil-borne diseases, remains poorly understood. Objective: This study aims to investigate the mechanism of optimized fertilization in mitigating soil-borne diseases by comparing the responses of bulk and rhizosphere soils to different fertilizer applications. Methods: We investigated the effects of fertilization methods on soil chemical properties, microbial communities, early blight and yields through a six-year continuous potato cropping experiment, including optimized fertilization (NPK), farmer fertilization practice (FP), nutrient omissions, and application of agricultural organic materials. Results: NPK alleviated early blight in potatoes and slowed down yield reduction by 33.9 %. NPK with corn straw or sheep manure increased particulate organic matter (POM), reduced the disease index (2.25% and 3.80%, respectively), and had more significant effect on fungal community in bulk soil (R2 = 0.45, P = 0.002) than rhizosphere soil. The results demonstrated that optimized fertilization facilitated carbon accumulation in bulk soil and nitrogen fixation in rhizosphere soil. Moreover, the impacts of nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium on microbial communities differed between bulk and rhizosphere soils, largely due to the responses of POM. We identified POM as a key factor influencing soil-borne diseases and demonstrated its relationship with disease suppression. Conclusions: Optimized fertilization was found to mitigate early blight and reduce yield loss by increasing POM, a key factor influencing soil-borne diseases and balancing fungal communities in continuous cropping soils. Significance: Our research sheds light on the mechanism of optimized fertilization in abating soil-borne diseases, which remained elusive in prior studies. For the first time, we identified and demonstrated the strong association between POM and soil-borne disease. These findings highlight the crucial, yet often overlooked, role of bulk soil quality in suppressing soil-borne disease and provide valuable insights into cultivating disease-suppressing soils.","2025-03-01","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:35","2025-01-25","","","","322","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001399909400001","","","2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Suresh","Morphological and productivity response of chickpea (cicer arietinum L.) to nano biofertilization","Legume Research","","0250-5371","10.18805/LR-5368","","Background: Chickpea productivity in the last decade has been declined due to improper management of inorganic and organic nutrient sources and it has been contended that the usual native soil rhizobial populations are insufficient/ineffective in N2 - fixation. Rhizobium based biofertilizers may substitute nitrogenous chemical fertilizers and provide a suitable way of achieving sustainable production. The effective use of exogeneous application of nano emulsion biofertilizer can enhance yield by reducing flower drop, regulating pod formation besides improving soil quality. In view of above consideration, the present investigation entitled ""Morphological and productivity response of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) to nano biofertilization"" was carried out. Methods: The field experiment was conducted on sandy clayey loam soil during two consecutive Rabi seasons of 2022-2023 and 2023-2024. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design (Factor) with three replications, assigning 45 treatments consisting of five soil applications (100% RDF; 100% RDF + FYM; 100% RDF + Vermicompost; 75% RDF + FYM; and 75% RDF + Vermicompost) as first factor and three foliar applications (Nano DAP; Nano Urea and Nano emulsion biofertilizer) as second factor treatments. Result: Application of Nano emulsion biofertilizer to chickpea variety (NBeG-49) at harvest had shown significant higher plant height mg g-1 day-1), chlorophyll (SPAD value) (58.22), number of pods/plant (24.93), seed yield (1111.60 kg ha-1), straw yield (2501.10 kg ha-1) and nitrogen uptake (70.56 kg ha-1), phosphorus uptake (203.21 kg ha-1) and potassium uptake (54.30 kg ha-1).","2024-12","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:59","2025-01-03","2123-2128","","12","47","","Legume Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","WOS:001385875000014","","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-08-27]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comprehensively quantifying the impact of crop production on the environment can provide a basis for crop sustainable production. A series of environmental footprint approaches, including carbon footprint (CF), nitrogen footprint (NF) and water footprint (WF), were optimized to evaluate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reactive nitrogen (Nr) loss and water resource consumption in crop production, and a comprehensive footprint method based on Endpoint modeling was proposed to evaluate the overall environmental impact of crop production in China. The CF, NF and WF of 28 forms of crop production varied from 1206.29 kg CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) ha(-1) of oil crops to 7326.37 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) of fiber crops, 16.07 kg Nr-eq ha(-1) of oil crops to 60.70 kg Nr-eq ha(-1) of sugar crops, and 4032.04 m(3) ha(-1) oil crops to 12,476.28 m(3) ha(-1) of sugar crops, respectively. The contribution of each component to footprints varied greatly among different crops, and fertilizer manufacture, NH3 volatilization and green WF were generally the main contributors of CF, NF and WF, respectively. The total GHG emissions, Nr loss and water consumption were estimated to be 670.11 Tg CO2-eq, 5.50 Tg Nr-eq and 837.06 G m(3) for all crop production of China. The greenhouse vegetable with the highest area-scaled comprehensive footprint was 4.5 times that of the oil crops which had the lowest one. The contribution of crop production to the corresponding environmental impact in China was as low as 3.7%, of which NH3 volatilization contributed 48% and grain production contributed 72%. Mineral N fertilization was the main driver of the variation of comprehensive footprint between provinces, with reduction of N fertilizer application as an important way to reduce the environmental impact of crop production.","2022-06-10","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:04","2022-05-03","","","","824","","Sci.

On the other hand, these mineral fertilizers are more preferable than organic N-sources to raise protein content in bean seeds. Thus, the current study investigates to what extent organic fertilizers can partially substitute chemical N-inputs to satisfy plant needs for nutrients. Also, irradiating seeds is another approach to increase plant productivity by inducing further nutrient carriers to raise the effectiveness of the applied N-fertilizers. These two approaches were used in combination, in this study, to increase bean productivity grown on a poor fertile light textured soil (90.5% sand). To fulfill this aim, a field experiment was carried out during the winter season of 2017/2018 following a split plot design where the different N-sources (organic vs inorganic and mixtures of these two N- sources, all applied at the recommended dose i.e. 48 kg N ha-1) were plotted in the main plots while gamma-irradiated seed treatments were plotted in the subplots. Irradiating bean seeds with gamma rays at a rate of 20 Gy (the least dose) increased significantly NPK uptake by beans and also enhanced plant growth. This consequently raised significantly the grain yield; however, increasing the dose of seed irradiation (>20 Gy) lessened significantly plant growth parameters and seed yield. The combined N-treatments also raised considerably NPK uptake by bean and recording the highest significant increases in plant growth parameters and grain yield. Moreover, mixed treatments recorded comparable protein contents in bean grains vs plants received 100% ammonium sulphate. Combination between seed irradiation and mixed N-sources were of positive effect on plant growth parameters and grain yield at only 20 Gy, while these parameters decreased considerably thereafter. In conclusion, seed irradiation may be a useful technique to increase legume plant growth; however, slight increases in the used dose may negatively affect the total quantity of the grain yield. The aforementioned results highlight the importance of amending light textured soils with the mixed (organic+mineral) N-sources to increase the productivity of faba bean grown on a such soil.","2021","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:58:57","2022-01-19","175-186","","2","61","","Egypt.

Four representative rice-based CT practices were evaluated: no-tillage rice-wheat rotation (RT), rice-winter fallow (RF), and rice-green manure rotation with low (RM-LN) and high nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs (RM-HN). The RW, RT, and RF treatments were implemented continuously from 2012 to 2021. The RM-LN treatment was implemented from 2012 to 2016, followed by the RM-HN treatment in the same plots from 2017 to 2021. The results indicated that, compared to the RW treatment, the RT, RF, RM-LN, and RM-HN treatments resulted in decreases in total GHG emissions during the rice-growing season by 11.5 %, 40.2 % (P G 0.01), 41.0 % (P G 0.05), and 35.2 % (P G 0.05), respectively, within the corresponding years of implementation. When compared to the RW treatment, the RT and RM-LN treatments significantly reduced rice yields by 6.7 % (P G 0.01) and 8.7 % (P G 0.01), respectively. In contrast, the RF and RM-HN treatments had no significant impact on rice yields relative to RW across the corresponding years. Consequently, relative to the RW treatment, the RF and RM-HN treatments achieved reductions in rice yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of 31.3 % (P G 0.05) and 34.0 % (P G 0.05), respectively, across the corresponding years, while maintaining rice yields. These findings suggest that RF and RM-HN are effective CT practices for mitigating GHG emissions from rice paddies in the Yangtze River Delta region.","2025-04-01","2025-08-27 10:53:09","2025-08-27 10:57:34","2025-02-07","","","","381","","Agric.
